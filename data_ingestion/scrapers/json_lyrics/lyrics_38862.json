(Yourself)\nDo you wish that you loved me?\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd my reflection just won't smile back at me lik\u0435 I know it should\nAnd I would turn into a stranger in an instant if I could\nAnd there is som\u0435thing eating me alive, I don\u2019t know what it is\nMaybe not that you conceal your feelings, they just don't exist\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nDo you ever believe\nThat we can turn into different people?\nIt's getting harder to be (Myself)\nDo you wish that you loved me?\nCan we ever release?\nIs it better to just not feel?\nCan we hit delete?\nDo you wish that you loved me?\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd it\u2019s been so long that I'm forgetting what it feels like\nBut I'd rather not remind myself and leave it all behind\nAnd I've tried so hard to fix it all but nothing seems to help\nBut I cannot hope to give you what I cannot give myself\n\n[Outro]\nDo you wish that you loved me? (Smile back)\nDo you wish that you loved me? (At me)\nDo you wish that you loved me? oh-woah\nDo you wish that you loved me? (Please)\nDo you wish that you loved me? (Smile back)\nDo you wish that you loved me? (At me)\nDo you wish that you loved me? oh-woah\nDo you wish that you loved me?1Embed"}
