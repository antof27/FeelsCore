{"Lyrics": "3 ContributorsIntro LyricsIt's been 912 days since we left earth\nIt feels like time gets slower and slower\u2005every\u2005day\nFunny how I\u2005say day, like that means anything\u2005anymore\nI can't remember the last time I saw the sky\nI can't remember what my favorite food tastes like\nI can't remember any of my friends' voice\n\nBut I do remember the last day\nPlants had all failed us\nAll of us, including themselves\nWe all thought we could handle him\nAnd we did for a while but\u2026we didn't\n\nThe final immense wasn't planned at all\nEverything's seemed so calmed and no one even talked about it for the last decades\nI got lucky, I guess\nI'm one of the few who got two extra years\nBut now it has been months since the last reply and the communication system broke so, I'm trapped in a box in the immensity of space and yes, I'm alive but I'm also an endling\n\nI'm doing this because I'm afraid this might be humanity's last chance to say something\nAnd I know it's stupid and I'm basically screaming into the void but I need to try, so:\n\nHello, we existed\nWe were rebellious, smart, passionate, sinners\nWe were the last humans left\nI really wish we could've survived our time so that we could live in the earth, but there's no luckYou might also like1Embed"}
