{"Lyrics": "1 ContributorDesolation LyricsLight shines upon the shadows\nRevealing the grimmest of sights\nWonder is there anyone left alive to show\nMotionless victims lay, In pools of fluid they\nExpelled mucus, Lymphatic and blood\nLifeless as they lay down\nAttracting the rats and the mice\nWho once they prey on them also expire\nBody after body waits, In the makeshift mass graves\nLaying rotting and festering\n\nThey didn't even have time to bury their dead\nDropping like flies as they came to their end\nThey didn't even have time to bury their dead\nAs the sickness spread amongst them they failed to escape\n\nLight shines upon the shadows\nRevealing the grimmest of sights\nWonder is there anyone left alive to show\nMotionless victims lay, In pools of fluid they\nExpelled mucus, Lymphatic and blood\nLifeless as they lay down\nAttracting the rats and the mice\nWho once they prey on them also expire\nBody after body waits, In the makeshift mass graves\nLaying rotting and festering\nYou might also likeScores of open graves now litter the countryside\nThe ones who escaped never made it too far\nThe anguish that they felt is clear to be seen now\nAll across the lands the scenes are the same\n\nThe harrowing sight of endless pyres\nThey tried to burn it all away\nAs evidence spread throughout - There would be no escape\nThey fled\nAnyway hoping that some sort of sanctum could be reached\nIt struck them down as well\nAll engulfing\nSo clear there could be no emancipation from\nThe fate of all the others\nIt drives them to endure hell\n\nPassing throughout the wasteland\nA scene descript of pure agony\nHoping and fucking praying\nThat they would reach some form of sanctitude\n\nBurn in hell\n\nThey didn't even have time to bury their deadEmbed"}
