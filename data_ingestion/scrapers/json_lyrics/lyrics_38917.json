{"Lyrics": "1 ContributorShark Spray Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI'm staring at an empty room\nWhile you're running again\nNot listening\nAnd now you're\nStaring at my every move\nWith predatory eyes\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIf blood is thicker than water then why am I bleeding out?\nTwisting the knife in my spine\nYou'd kick me while I'm down\n\n[Chorus]\nHolding it over my head and I can't breathe\nYou're reaching for the tear inside of me\nEvery time that I say I'm done\nYou pull me back again\nAnd I feel stupid\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou never really cared that much\nBut we're not the same\nSo don't try to play the victim\nBlaming me 'cause I moved on\nGuess I'm the problem now\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nYou cut me, bloods in the water, and sharks are circling (Circling)\nBut I'm done living under the weight of your sadistic hold on me\n\n[Chorus]\nHolding it over my head and I can't breathe\nYou're reaching for the tear inside of me\nEvery time that I say I'm done\nYou pull me back again\nAnd I feel\nStupid, stupid\nDon't wanna get used to choosing\nI'm wasting all my oxygen\nAnd I'm over this brokenness\nI'm over it\n\n[Bridge]\nYour bridges going down in flames\nEmbracing the enemy\nSever me from your disease\n'Cause you make me sick\nBlegh\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou held it over my head for way too long but now the strings are gone\n[Chorus]\nHolding it over my head and I can't breathe\nYou're reaching for the tear inside of me\nEvery time that I say I'm done\nYou pull me back again\nAnd I feel\nStupid, stupid\nDon't wanna get used to choosing\nI'm wasting all my oxygen\nAnd I'm over this brokenness\nI'm over it\nOver it\nOverEmbed"}
