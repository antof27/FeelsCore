{"Lyrics": "1 ContributorDisconnect LyricsI lost my source\nIn a world that constantly spinning\nAnd falling apart\nDrowning in the depth of emotions\nNo wave comes to me\nNo breath left to be\nI can't find my connections\nMy thoughts are in a bind\nI struggle to find a way out of this grind\n\nMy mind is a glitch\nNobody searches for the unknown\n\nSilence reigns and seals my lips\nI'm dragged out and disconnect\nI'm drained, no one remembers my name\nPlugged out of this universe\n\nA stranger living under my skin\nTaken over and shut me in\nFeeling adrift, like I don't even exist\nLost in the darkness, can't find my peace\nStrayed from the path, for far too long\nNow I'm too numb to feel\nI've been looking for a spark to ignite the fire\nTo warm my cold heart\nYou might also likeSilence reigns and seals my lips\nI'm dragged out and disconnect\nI'm drained, no one remembers my name\nPlugged out of this universe\n\nThis is a warning, my connection fails\nThis is a warning, my connection fails\nThis is a warning, my connection fails\nI'm disconnected\n\nI'm dragged out and disconnect\nPlugged out of this universe\nMy connection fails and disconnectEmbed"}
