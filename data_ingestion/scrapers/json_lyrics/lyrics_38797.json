{"Lyrics": "1 ContributorThe Castle Portal LyricsCan\u2019t you see the martyrs?\nForever crowned in prolonged misery\nOne belief in the higher\nForgotten dreams from a kingdom out of reach\n\nThe ending nears the path alone\nBeyond relation to the world I\u2019ve known\nConstellation of fates to weigh\nDisposed horizon, a friend betrayed\n\nTonight we\u2019ve gone to hell\nBegging the skies to speak\nThe muse of glows fades from our sight\nThis is the home that we seek\n\nTell a truth to me\nDeath will set you free\n\nThrough the vapor\u2019s rise\nI notice the color\u2019s all the same\nSpared from falling downwards\nHeld in the gray between\n\nGo from Earth to see\nI forsake this sleep\nYou might also likeI can see they lower me in the ground\n\nSacrifice for this nothing\nWithered the gates to pry\nAbsent disorder of spirit decay\nThe remains ignite\nCursed to live again\n\nThe reaping cries of liars\nDamning me from returning once again\nOne\u2019s lone desire\nAcross the trees, further from the rise\n\nThe ending nears the path alone\nBeyond relation to the world I\u2019ve known\nConstellation of fates to weigh\nThe frozen silence begs me to stay\n\n\nTell a truth to me\nDeath will set me free\n\nThrough the vapor\u2019s rise\nI notice the color is all the same\nSpared from falling downwards\nHeld in the gray between\nGo from Earth to see\nI forsake this sleep\n\nForgoes this fated line built from grim wonder\nWe sail beneath under the corners of your eyes\nChariots of steam holding the lie closerEmbed"}
