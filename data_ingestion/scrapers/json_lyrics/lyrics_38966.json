(Be like this?)\n\nThe pain, it's in every fucking lesson\nIll hold this weight till the very last message\nIf he made me, why did I have to be like this? (Be like this?)\n\nI'm stuck with myself and that's never been enough\nI'm looking for a way out and I'm losing touch\n\nThey never listened\nAlways had a condition\nThey never listened\nAlways had a condition\nThey never listened\nAlways had a condition\nThey never listened\nAlways had a condition\n\nIt's just an underlying hum\nIt's just an underlying humEmbed"}
