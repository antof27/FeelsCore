{"Lyrics": "2 Contributors...and I\u2019m an Addict LyricsI can't open my eyes without thinking \u2018bout you\nYour kiss, stains my lips and I'm lost, floating in ecstasy\nYou're never too far gone to come back to me\n\nNow I feel you\nYou're running through my veins\n\nAnd this is never the way but by the end of the day my head's spinning and again it's too late\n\nIt's been a long time coming and I've been waiting for the day\nWhere I can tell you honestly\nI've already lost control and I'm scared I'm losing even more\n\nWell cheers to that\n\nWell you can call it withdrawal but when you're not in my world\nMy hands shake and my heart beat feels fake\nIt's like the lights get too bright and I go full fight or flight\nNow I'm sweating, I just need you with me\n\nWell you know what they say\nLess is more and more's ok with me\nIt always starts with just a touch\nBut then I feel my head rush\n\nYeah I feel you ruining my day\nYou might also likeBut I drink anyway\n\nIt's been a long time coming and I've been waiting for the day\nWhere I can tell you honestly\nI've already lost control and I'm scared I'm losing even more\nSomeone take this glass from me I can't see my way out\n\nSo here's the thing I wake in the morning and I feel ok, a sore head but I'm ready for the day and I think to myself, there's got to be another way \u2018cause I can be strong and I can be kind and I can be anything I fucking like, so why do I resort to being what I am, an addict, a junkie, a lesser man, well I won't have it. And so the cycle goes, wake up, regret, pass out, repeat, I'm so bored of lying to myself and I hate what I've become, someone pass the bottle, I'm done\n\nAnd so the cycle goes\nWake up\nRegret\nPass out\nRepeat\nOnce more\nWake up\nRegret\nPass out\nRepeat\nNo moreEmbed"}
