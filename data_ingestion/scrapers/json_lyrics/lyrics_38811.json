{"Lyrics": "2 ContributorsThe Last Ember LyricsSome people plan their lives\nSome people's plan is to stay alive\nAll I can focus on is to not fall apart\nI've got no power for a restart\n\nEchoes in the back of my mind\nNot a change towards serenity kind\nThey rip me to the different directions\nBody and soul, they've lost the connection\n\nI've got nothing to crawl back for\nFrom these ashes nothing will be reborn\nWhat I left behind, never meant to be mine\nAll we do is pick the wrong life and die\n\nCan't feel my hands when I wake up in sweat\nI feel so cold while I'm burning to death\nI don't know where to start\nI don't know where to stop\nAll I know, this ache keeps tightening the knot\n\nI've got nothing to crawl back for\nFrom these ashes nothing will be reborn\nWhat I left behind, never meant to be mine\nAll we do is pick the wrong life and die\nYou might also likeI've got nothing to crawl back for\nFrom these ashes nothing will be rebornEmbed"}
