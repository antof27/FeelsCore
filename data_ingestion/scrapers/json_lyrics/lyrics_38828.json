{"Lyrics": "1 ContributorLost Hope LyricsDon't try to give up\n\nAwoken with another bottle down\nTrying to get everything together\nWatching like days are crushing into pieces\nNights became the escape\nWith the pills in your hands\nLethal injection of a lost hope\nBroken wings and crushed dreams\n\nStreets changed into the home\nCarrying heart on the hand\nExpecting help, expecting salvation\nAlone with madness of bad decisions\nTrying to keep your head up\nBut falling, still deeper and deeper\n\nYou know these feelings too w\u0435ll\nTo say that everything's gonna be ok\nYou know th\u0435se feelings too well\nTo say that everything will be fixed by itself\n\nDon't try to stop\nDon't try to give up\nYou have to go\nBreath!\nYou might also likeWhen you go through this shit alone\nLosing all your ends\nRemember there's still hope\nFor better days\nThere's always someone with you\nThere's always someone for you\nWhen you go through this shit alone\nRemember there's still hopeEmbed"}
