{"Lyrics": "3 ContributorsBLACK_WAVE LyricsYour weak wrist twist and scream for my shattered frame\nChew your tongue red and reeling, cause you feel the pain\nWe push ourselves through the night to see how good it could feel\nCrooked teeth sharp to please me, in vain\n\nNothing left in the end, you leave me no choice\nYou love to scream \u2018til I\u2019m deaf and there\u2019s no voice\nSpill your guts to the snake, fear me in a new way\nCause I\u2019m running out of time, try to keep the pace\n\nYou\u2019re a vision spilling down\nDisappearing slowly now\nI can\u2019t stop, saw me off\nHollowed out, you\u2019re a shell\nMake a home for myself\nI won\u2019t stop \u2018til you\u2019re gone\nThink I\u2019m lost in the black wave\n\nViolent, lights off\nRipped skin when I\u2019m digging the hooks in\nViolent, lights off\nCrimson when I sow you together\n\nCrawl inside, then divide you\nWanna wear your skin\nPushed my teeth to the bone\nYou wanna do it again\nYou might also likeI forced myself through the night\nSo show me how you fucking feel\n\nYou\u2019re a vision spilling down\nDisappearing slowly now\nI can\u2019t stop, saw me off\nHollowed out, you\u2019re a shell\nMake a home for myself\nI won\u2019t stop \u2018till you\u2019re gone\n\nThink I\u2019m lost in the black wave\nThink I\u2019m lost in the black wave\n\nNothing left so abort me cause I\u2019m pro-choice\nYou\u2019ve been screaming to the deaf, you have no voice\nSpilled your guts for my sake but I stole your face\nI won\u2019t stop, think I\u2019m lost in the black wave\n\nThink I\u2019m lost in the black waveEmbed"}
