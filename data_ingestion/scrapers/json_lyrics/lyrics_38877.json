{"Lyrics": "1 ContributorSomber LyricsIt\u2019s funny how it all turns out\nEven through our own self doubt\nEvery word we say\nWe drift further from the way\nWe promised we\u2019d always remain\n\nA body made of sticks and stones\nIt\u2019s easier to be alone\nMy vision turns to grey\nIt Gets harder every day\nTo keep all these demons away\n\nI\u2019ll shut down every word\nI\u2019ll hit you where it hurts\nResentment is a somber song\nIf all we have to hold\nAre the words on which you choke\nThen say it baby\nDo you ever miss me when I\u2019m gone\n\nI\u2019m digging up above the ground\nThe parts of me that I have found\nStitching up my heart\nLeave me here to make a start\nFrom a world that\u2019s now falling apart\nYou might also likeWhat I\u2019ve seen\nIs you never really cared for me\nSo it seems\nThat This should be easy\n\n\nHave you ever opened your eyes to realize you\u2019re still blind\nDo you ever blame yourself for wasting all my time\n\nSincerely\n(I let you go alone)\n\nPassionately\n(You\u2019ll never feel at home)1Embed"}
