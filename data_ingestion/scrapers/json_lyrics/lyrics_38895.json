{"Lyrics": "10 ContributorsLooking for Alaska LyricsBefore\nOne Hundred and Thirty-six Days Before\n\nThe week before I left my family and Florida and the rest of my minor life to go to boarding school in Alabama, my mother insisted on throwing me a going-away party. To say that I had low expectations would be to underestimate the matter dramatically.\n\nAlthough I was more or less forced to invite all my \u201cschool friends\u201d, i.e. the ragtag bunch of drama people and English geeks I sat with by social necessity in the cavernous cafeteria of my public school, I knew they wouldn\u2019t come.\n\nStill, my mother persevered, awash in the delusion that I had kept my popularity secret from her all these years. She cooked a small mountain of artichoke dip. She festooned our living room in green and yellow streamers, the colours of my new school. She bought two dozen champagne poppers and placed them around the edge of our coffee table.\n\nAnd when that final Friday came, when my packing was mostly done, she sat with my dad and me on the living-room couch at 4.56 p.m. and patiently awaited the arrival of the Goodbye to Miles cavalry. Said cavalry consisted of exactly two people: Marie Lawson, a tiny blonde with rectangular glasses, and her chunky (to put it charitably) boyfriend Will.\n\nHey, Miles,\u201d Marie said as she sat down.\n\nHey,\u201d I said.\n\nHow was your summer?\u201d Will asked.\n\nOK. Yours?\u201d\n\nGood. We did Jesus Christ Superstar. I helped with the sets. Marie did lights,\u201d said Will.\n\nThat\u2019s cool.\u201d\n\nI nodded knowingly, and that about exhausted our conversational topics. I might have asked a question about Jesus Christ Superstar, except (1) I didn\u2019t know what it was and (2) I didn\u2019t care to learn, and (3) I never really excelled at small talk.\nMy mom, however, can talk small for hours, and so she extended the awkwardness by asking them about their rehearsal schedule, and how the show had gone, and whether it was a success.\n\nI guess it was,\u201d Marie said. \u201cA lot of people came, I guess.\u201d Marie was the sort of person to guess a lot.\n\nFinally, Will said, \u201cWell, we just dropped by to say goodbye. I\u2019ve got to get Marie home by six. Have fun at boarding school, Miles.\u201d\n\nThanks,\u201d I answered, relieved. The only thing worse than having a party that no one attends is having a party attended only by two vastly, deeply uninteresting people.\n\nThey left, and so I sat with my parents and stared at the blank TV and wanted to turn it on, but knew I shouldn\u2019t. I could feel them both looking at me, waiting for me to burst into tears or something, as if I hadn\u2019t known all along that it would go precisely like this.\n\nBut I had known. I could feel their pity as they scooped artichoke dip with chips intended for my imaginary friends, but they needed pity more than I did: I wasn\u2019t disappointed. My expectations had been met.\n\nIs this why you want to leave, Miles?\u201d Mom asked.\n\nI mulled it over for a moment, careful not to look at her. \u201cUh, no,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cWell, why then?\u201d she asked. This was not the first time she had posed the question. Mom was not particularly keen on letting me go to boarding school and had made no secret of it.\n\nBecause of me?\u201d my dad asked. He had attended Culver Creek, the same boarding school to which I was headed, as had both of his brothers and all of their kids. I think he liked the idea of me following in his footsteps.\n\nMy uncles had told me stories about how famous my dad had been on campus for having simultaneously raised hell and aced all his classes. That sounded like a better life than the one I had in Florida. But no, it wasn\u2019t because of Dad. Not exactly.\n\nHold on,\u201d I said. I went into Dad\u2019s study and found his biography of Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais. I liked reading biographies of writers, even if (as was the case with Monsieur Rabelais) I\u2019d never read any of their actual writing. I flipped to the back and found the highlighted quote (\u201cNEVER USE A HIGHLIGHTER IN MY BOOKS,\u201d my dad had told me a thousand times.\n\nBut how else are you supposed to find what you\u2019re looking for?).\nSo this guy,\u201d I said, standing in the doorway of the living room, \u201cFran\u00e7ois Rabelais. He was this poet. And his last words were, \u2018I go to seek a Great Perhaps.\u2019 That\u2019s why I\u2019m going. So I don\u2019t have to wait until I die to start seeking a Great Perhaps.\u201d\n\nAnd that quieted them. I was after a Great Perhaps, and they knew as well as I did that I wasn\u2019t going to find it with the likes of Will and Marie.\n\nI sat back down on the couch, between my mom and my dad, and my dad put his arm around me and we stayed there like that, quiet on the couch together, for a long time, until it seemed OK to turn on the TV, and then we ate artichoke dip for dinner and watched the History Channel and as going-away parties go, it certainly could have been worse.\n\nOne Hundred and Twenty-eight Days Before\n\nFlorida was plenty hot, certainly, and humid too. Hot enough that your clothes stuck to you like Scotch tape, and sweat dripped like tears from your forehead into your eyes. But it was only hot outside, and generally I only went outside to walk from one air-conditioned location to another.\n\nThis did not prepare me for the unique sort of heat that one encounters fifteen miles south of Birmingham, Alabama, at Culver Creek Preparatory School.\n\nMy parents\u2019 SUV was parked in the grass just a few feet outside my dorm room, Room 43. But each time I took those few steps to and from the car to unload what now seemed like far too much stuff, the sun burnt through my clothes and into my skin with a vicious ferocity that made me genuinely fear hellfire.\n\nBetween Mom and Dad and me, it only took a few minutes to unload the car, but my un-air-conditioned dorm room, although blessedly out of the sunshine, was only modestly cooler. The room surprised me: I\u2019d pictured plush carpet, wood-panelled walls, Victorian furniture.\n\nAside from one luxury \u2013 a private bathroom \u2013 I got a box. With cinderblock walls coated thick with layers of white paint and a green-and-white chequered linoleum floor, the place looked more like a hospital than the dorm room of my fantasies.\n\nA bunk bed of unfinished wood with vinyl mattresses was pushed against the room\u2019s back window. The desks and dressers and bookshelves were all attached to the walls in order to prevent creative floor planning.\n\nAnd no air-conditioning.\n\nI sat on the lower bunk while Mom opened the trunk, grabbed a stack of the biographies my dad had agreed to part with and placed them on the bookshelves.\n\nI can unpack, Mom,\u201d I said. My dad stood. He was ready to go.\nLet me at least make your bed,\u201d Mom said.\n\nNo, really. I can do it.\n\nIt\u2019s OK.\u201d Because you simply cannot draw these things out for ever. At some point, you just pull off the Band-Aid and it hurts, but then it\u2019s over and you\u2019re relieved.\n\nGod, we\u2019ll miss you,\u201d Mom said suddenly, stepping through the minefield of suitcases to get to the bed. I stood and hugged her. My dad walked over too, and we formed a sort of huddle.\n\nIt was too hot, and we were too sweaty, for the hug to last terribly long. I knew I ought to cry, but I\u2019d lived with my parents for sixteen years and a trial separation seemed overdue.\n\nDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I smiled. \u201cI\u2019s a-gonna learn how t\u2019talk right Southern.\u201d Mom laughed.\n\nDon\u2019t do anything stupid,\u201d my dad said.\n\nOK.\u201d\n\nNo drugs. No drinking. No cigarettes.\u201d As an alumnus of Culver Creek, he had done the things I had only heard about: the secret parties, streaking through hayfields (he always whined about how it was all boys back then), drugs, drinking and cigarettes. It had taken him a while to kick smoking, but his bad-ass days were now well behind him.\n\nI love you,\u201d they both blurted out simultaneously. It needed to be said, but the words made the whole thing horribly uncomfortable, like watching your grandparents kiss.\n\nI love you too. I\u2019ll call every Sunday.\u201d Our rooms had no phone lines, but my parents had requested I be placed in a room near one of Culver Creek\u2019s five payphones.\n\nThey hugged me again \u2013 Mom, then Dad \u2013 and it was over. Out the back window, I watched them drive the winding road off campus. I should have felt a gooey, sentimental sadness perhaps.\n\nBut mostly I just wanted to cool off, so I grabbed one of the desk chairs and sat down outside my door in the shade of the overhanging eaves, waiting for a breeze that never arrived.\n\nThe air outside sat as still and oppressive as the air inside. I stared out over my new digs: six one-storey buildings, each with sixteen dorm rooms, were arranged in a hexagram around a large circle of grass. It looked like an oversized old motel.\n\nEverywhere, boys and girls hugged and smiled and walked together. I vaguely hoped that someone would come up and talk to me. I imagined the conversation:\n\nHey. Is this your first year?\u201d\n\nYeah. Yeah. I\u2019m from Florida.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s cool. So you\u2019re used to the heat.\u201d\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be used to this heat if I were from Hades,\u201d I\u2019d joke. I\u2019d make a good first impression.\n\nOh, he\u2019s funny. That guy Miles is a riot.\n\nThat didn\u2019t happen, of course. Things never happened like I imagined them.\n\nBored, I went back inside, took off my shirt, lay down on the heat-soaked vinyl of the lower bunk mattress and closed my eyes. I\u2019d never been born again with the baptism and weeping and all that, but it couldn\u2019t feel much better than being born again as a guy with no known past.\n\nI thought of the people I\u2019d read about \u2013 John F Kennedy, James Joyce, Humphrey Bogart \u2013 who went to boarding school, and their adventures; Kennedy, for example, loved pranks. I thought of the Great Perhaps and the things that might happen and the people I might meet and who my roommate might be (I\u2019d gotten a letter a few weeks before that gave me his name, Chip Martin, but no other information).\n\nWhoever Chip Martin was, I hoped to God he would bring an arsenal of high-powered fans, because I hadn\u2019t packed even one and I could already feel my sweat pooling on the vinyl mattress, which disgusted me so much that I stopped thinking and got off my ass to find a towel to wipe up the sweat with. And then I thought, Well, before the adventure comes the unpacking\n\nI managed to tape a map of the world to the wall and get most of my clothes into drawers before I noticed that the hot, moist air made even the walls sweat, and I decided that now was not the time for manual labour.\n\nNow was the time for a magnificently cold shower.\n\nThe small bathroom contained a huge, full-length mirror behind the door and so I could not escape the reflection of my naked self as I leaned in to turn on the shower faucet.\n\nMy skinniness always surprised me: my thin arms didn\u2019t seem to get much bigger as they moved from wrist to shoulder, my chest lacked any hint of either fat or muscle, and I felt embarrassed and wondered if something could be done about the mirror. I pulled open the plain white shower curtain and ducked into the stall.\n\nUnfortunately, the shower seemed to have been designed for someone approximately three feet, seven inches tall, so the cold water hit my lower ribcage \u2013 with all the force of a dripping faucet. To wet my sweat-soaked face, I had to spread my legs and squat significantly.\n\nSurely, John F Kennedy (who was six feet tall according to his biography, my height exactly) did not have to squat at his boarding school.\n\nNo, this was a different beast entirely, and as the dribbling shower slowly soaked my body, I wondered whether I could find a Great Perhaps here at all or whether I had made a grand miscalculation.\n\nWhen I opened the bathroom door after my shower, a towel wrapped around my waist, I saw a short, muscular guy with a shock of brown hair. He was hauling a gigantic army-green duffel bag through the door of my room. He stood five feet and nothing, but was well-built, like a scale model of Adonis, and with him arrived the stink of stale cigarette smoke.\n\nGreat, I thought. I\u2019m meeting my roommate naked. He heaved the duffel into the room, closed the door and walked over to me.\n\nI\u2019m Chip Martin,\u201d he announced in a deep voice, the voice of a radio DJ. Before I could respond, he added, \u201cI\u2019d shake your hand, but I think you should hold on damn tight to that towel till you can get some clothes on.\u201d\n\nI laughed and nodded my head at him (that\u2019s cool, right? the nod?) and said, \u201cI\u2019m Miles Halter. Nice to meet you.\u201d\n\nMiles as in \u2018to go before I sleep\u2019?\u201d he asked me.\n\nHuh?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a Robert Frost poem. You\u2019ve never read him?\u201d\n\nI shook my head no.\n\nConsider yourself lucky.\u201d He smiled.\n\nI grabbed some clean underwear, a pair of blue Adidas soccer shorts and a white T-shirt, mumbled that I\u2019d be back in a second and ducked back into the bathroom. So much for a good first impression.\n\nSo where are your parents?\u201d I asked from the bathroom.\n\nMy parents? The father\u2019s in California right now. Maybe sitting in his La-Z-Boy. Maybe driving his truck. Either way, he\u2019s drinking. My mother is probably just now turning off campus.\u201d\n\nOh,\u201d I said, dressed now, not sure how to respond to such personal information. I shouldn\u2019t have asked, I guess, if I didn\u2019t want to know.\n\nChip grabbed some sheets and tossed them on to the top bunk. \u201cI\u2019m a top bunk man. Hope that doesn\u2019t bother you.\u201d\n\nUh, no. Whatever is fine.\u201d\n\nI see you\u2019ve decorated the place,\u201d he said, gesturing towards the world map. \u201cI like it.\u201d\n\nAnd then he started naming countries. He spoke in a monotone, as if he\u2019d done it a thousand times before.\n\nAfghanistan.\n\nAlbania.\n\nAlgeria.\n\nAmerican Samoa.\n\nAndorra.\n\nAnd so on. He got through the A\u2019s before looking up and noticing my incredulous stare.\n\nI could do the rest, but it\u2019d probably bore you.\n\nSomething I learned over the summer.\n\nGod, you can\u2019t imagine how boring New Hope, Alabama, is in the summertime. Like watching soybeans grow. Where are you from, by the way?\u201d\n\nFlorida,\u201d I said.\n\nNever been.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s pretty amazing, the countries thing,\u201d I said.\n\nYeah, everybody\u2019s got a talent. I can memorise things. And you can \u2026?\u201d\n\nUm, I know a lot of people\u2019s last words.\u201d It was an indulgence, learning last words. Other people had chocolate; I had dying declarations.\n\nExample?\u201d\n\nI like Henrik Ibsen\u2019s. He was a playwright.\u201d I knew a lot about Ibsen, but I\u2019d never read any of his plays. I didn\u2019t like reading plays. I liked reading biographies.\n\nYeah, I know who he was,\u201d said Chip.\n\nRight, well, he\u2019d been sick for a while and his nurse said to him, \u2018You seem to be feeling better this morning,\u2019 and Ibsen looked at her and said, \u2018On the contrary,\u2019 and then he died.\u201d\n\nChip laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s morbid. But I like it.\u201d\n\nHe told me he was in his third year at Culver Creek. He had started in ninth grade, the first year at the school, and was now a junior like me.\n\nA scholarship kid, he said. Got a full ride. He\u2019d heard it was the best school in Alabama, so he wrote his application essay about how he wanted to go to a school where he could read long books.\n\nThe problem, he said in the essay, was that his dad would always hit him with the books in his house, so Chip kept his books short and paperback for his own safety. His parents got divorced his sophomore year.\n\nHe liked \u201cthe Creek\u201d, as he called it, but, \u201cYou have to be careful here, with students and with teachers. And I do hate being careful,\u201d he smirked. I hated being careful too \u2013 or wanted to, at least.\n\nHe told me this while ripping through his duffel bag, throwing clothes into drawers with reckless abandon. Chip did not believe in having a sock drawer or a T-shirt drawer. He believed that all drawers were created equal and filled each with whatever fit. My mother would have died.\n\nAs soon as he finished \u201cunpacking\u201d, Chip hit me roughly on the shoulder, said, \u201cI hope you\u2019re stronger than you look,\u201d and walked out the door, leaving it open behind him. He peeked his head back in a few seconds later and saw me standing still. \u201cWell, come on, Miles To Go Halter. We got shit to do.\u201d\n\nWe made out way to the TV room, which according to Chip contained the only cable TV on campus. Over the summer, it served as a storage unit.\n\nPacked nearly to the ceiling with couches, fridges and rolled-up carpets, the TV room undulated with kids trying to find and haul away their stuff. Chip said hello to a few people, but didn\u2019t introduce me.\n\n\nAs he wandered through the couch-stocked maze, I stood near the door, trying my best not to block pairs of roommates as they manoeuvred furniture through the narrow front door.\n\nIt took ten minutes for Chip to find his stuff, and an hour more for us to make four trips back and forth across the dorm circle between the TV room and Room 43. By the end, I wanted to crawl into Chip\u2019s minifridge and sleep for a thousand years, but Chip seemed immune to both fatigue and heatstroke. I sat down on his couch.\n\nI found it lying on a curb in my neighbourhood a couple of years ago,\u201d he said of the couch as he worked on setting up my PlayStation 2 on top of his footlocker. \u201cI know the leather\u2019s got some cracks, but come on. That\u2019s a damn nice couch.\u201d The leather had more than a few cracks \u2013 it was about 30 per cent baby-blue faux leather and 70 per cent foam \u2013 but it felt damn good to me anyway.\n\nAll right,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re about done.\u201d He walked over to his desk and pulled a roll of duct tape from a drawer. \u201cWe just need your trunk.\u201d\n\nI got up, pulled the trunk out from under the bed, and Chip situated it between the couch and the PlayStation 2 and started tearing off thin strips of duct tape. He applied them to the trunk so that they spelled out COFFEE TABLE.\n\nThere,\u201d he said. He sat down and put his feet up on the, uh, coffee table.\n\nDone.\u201d\n\nI sat down next to him, and he looked over at me and suddenly said, \u201cListen. I\u2019m not going to be your entr\u00e9e to Culver Creek social life.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh, OK,\u201d I said, but I could hear the words catch in my throat. I\u2019d just carried this guy\u2019s couch beneath a white-hot sun and now he doesn\u2019t like me?\n\nBasically, you\u2019ve got two groups here,\u201d he explained, speaking with increasing urgency.\n\nYou\u2019ve got the regular boarders, like me, and then you\u2019ve got the Weekday Warriors; they board here, but they\u2019re all rich kids who live in Birmingham and go home to their parents\u2019 air-conditioned mansions every weekend.\n\nThose are the cool kids. I don\u2019t like them and they don\u2019t like me, and so if you came here thinking that you were hot shit at public school so you\u2019ll be hot shit here, you\u2019d best not be seen with me. You did go to public school didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nUh\u2026\u201d I said. Absentmindedly, I began picking at the cracks in the couch\u2019s leather, digging my fingers into the foamy whiteness.\n\nRight, you did probably, because if you had gone to a private school your freakin\u2019 shorts would fit.\u201d He laughed.\n\nI wore my shorts just below my hips, which I thought was cool. Finally, I said, \u201cYeah, I went to public school. But I wasn\u2019t hot shit there, Chip. I was regular shit.\u201d\n\nHa! That\u2019s good. And don\u2019t call me Chip. Call me the Colonel.\u201d\n\nI stifled a laugh.\n\n\u201cThe Colonel?\u201d\n\nYeah. The Colonel.\n\nAnd we\u2019ll call you \u2026hmm. Pudge.\u201d\n\nHuh?\u201d\n\nPudge,\u201d the Colonel said. \u201cBecause you\u2019re skinny. It\u2019s called irony, Pudge. Heard of it? Now, let\u2019s go get some cigarettes and start this year off right.\u201d\n\nHe walked out of the room, again just assuming I\u2019d follow, and this time I did. Mercifully, the sun was descending towards the horizon. We walked five doors down to Room 48. A dry-erase board was taped to the door using duct tape. In blue marker, it read, Alaska has a single!\n\nThe Colonel explained to me that (1) this was Alaska\u2019s room, and that (2) she had a single room because the girl who was supposed to be her roommate got kicked out at the end of the last year, and that (3) Alaska had cigarettes, although the Colonel neglected to ask whether (4) I smoked, which (5) I didn\u2019t.\n\nHe knocked once, loudly. Through the door, a voice screamed, \u201cOh my God, come in you short little man because I have the best story.\u201d\n\nAnd we walked in. I turned to close the door behind me, and the Colonel shook his head and said, \u201cAfter seven, you have to leave the door open if you\u2019re in a girl\u2019s room,\u201d but I barely heard him because the hottest girl in all of human history was standing before me in cut-off jeans and a peach tank top. And she was talking over the Colonel, talking loud and fast.\n\nSo first day of summer, I\u2019m in grand old Vine Station with this boy named Justin and we\u2019re at his house watching TV on the couch \u2013 and mind you, I\u2019m already dating Jake \u2013 actually I\u2019m still dating him, miraculously enough, but Justin is a friend of mine from when\n\nI was a kid and so we\u2019re watching TV and literally chatting about the SATs or something, and Justin puts his arm around me and I think, Oh, that\u2019s nice, we\u2019ve been friends for so long and this is totally comfortable, and we\u2019re just chatting and then I\u2019m in the middle of a sentence about analogies or something and like a hawk he reaches down and he honks my boob.\n\nHONK.\n\nA much-too-firm, two\u2013 to three-second HONK. And the first thing I thought was, OK, how do I extricate this claw from my boob before it leaves permanent marks? and the second thing I thought was God, I can\u2019t wait to tell Takumi and the Colonel.\u201d\n\nThe Colonel laughed. I stared, stunned partly by the force of the voice emanating from the petite (but, God, curvy) girl and partly by the gigantic stacks of books that lined her walls. Her library filled her bookshelves and then overflowed into waist-high stacks of books everywhere, piled haphazardly against the walls.\n\nIf just one of them moved, I thought, the domino effect could engulf the three of us in an asphyxiating mass of literature.\n\nWho\u2019s the guy that\u2019s not laughing at my very funny story?\u201d she asked.\n\nOh, right. Alaska, this is Pudge. Pudge memorises people\u2019s last words. Pudge, this is Alaska. She got her boob honked over the summer.\u201d She walked over to me with her hand extended, then made a quick move downwards at the last moment and pulled down my shorts.\n\nThose are the biggest shorts in the state of Alabama!\u201d\n\nI like them baggy,\u201d I said, embarrassed, and pulled them up. They had been cool back home in Florida.\n\nSo far in our relationship, Pudge, I\u2019ve seen your chicken legs entirely too often,\u201d the Colonel deadpanned.\n\nSo, Alaska. Sell us some cigarettes.\u201d\n\nAnd then somehow, the Colonel talked me into paying five dollars for a pack of Marlboro Lights I had no intention of ever smoking.\n\n\nHe asked Alaska to join us, but she said, \u201cI have to find Takumi and tell him about The Honk.\u201d She turned to me and asked, \u201cHave you seen him?\u201d I had no idea whether I\u2019d seen Takumi, since I had no idea who he was. I just shook my head.\n\nAll right. Meet ya at the lake in a few minutes then.\u201d The Colonel nodded.\n\nAt the edge of the lake, just before the sandy (and, the Colonel told me, fake) beach, we sat down in an Adirondack swing. I made the obligatory joke: \u201cDon\u2019t grab my boob.\u201d\n\nThe Colonel gave an obligatory laugh, then asked, \u201cWant a smoke?\u201d I had never smoked a cigarette, but when in Rome \u2026\n\nIs it safe here?\u201d\n\nNot really,\u201d he said, then lit a cigarette and handed it to me. I inhaled. Coughed. Wheezed. Gasped for breath. Coughed again. Considered vomiting. Grabbed the swinging bench, head spinning, and threw the cigarette to the ground and stomped on it, convinced my Great Perhaps did not involve cigarettes.\n\nSmoke much?\u201d He laughed, then pointed to a white speck across the lake and said, \u201cSee that?\u201d\n\nYeah,\u201d I said.\n\nWhat is that? A bird?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the swan,\u201d he said.\n\nWow. A school with a swan. Wow.\u201d\n\nThat swan is the spawn of Satan. Never get closer to it than we are now.\u201d\n\nWhy?\u201d\n\nIt has some issues with people. It was abused or something. It\u2019ll rip you to pieces. The Eagle put it there to keep us from walking around the lake to smoke.\u201d\n\nThe Eagle?\u201d\n\nMr Starnes. Code name: the Eagle. The Dean of Students. Most of the teachers live on campus and they\u2019ll all bust you. But only the Eagle lives in the dorm circle and he sees all. He can smell a cigarette from like five miles.\u201d\n\nIsn\u2019t his house back there?\u201d I asked, pointing to it. I could see the house quite clearly despite the darkness, so it followed he could probably see us.\n\nYeah, but he doesn\u2019t really go into blitzkrieg mode until classes start,\u201d Chip said nonchalantly.\n\nGod, if I get in trouble my parents will kill me,\u201d I said.\n\nI suspect you\u2019re exaggerating. But look, you\u2019re going to get in trouble. Ninety-nine per cent of the time your parents never have to know though. The school doesn\u2019t want your parents to think you became a fuck-up here any more than you want your parents to think you\u2019re a fuck-up.\u201d He blew a thin stream of smoke forcefully towards the lake. I had to admit: he looked cool doing it. Taller, somehow.\n\nAnyway, when you get in trouble, just don\u2019t tell on anyone. I mean, I hate the rich snots here with a fervent passion I usually reserve only for dental work and my father. But that doesn\u2019t mean I would rat them out. Pretty much the only important thing is never never never never rat.\u201d\n\nOK,\u201d I said, although I wondered: if someone punches me in the face, I\u2019m supposed to insist that I ran into a door? It seemed a little stupid.\n\nHow do you deal with bullies and assholes if you can\u2019t get them into trouble? I didn\u2019t ask Chip though.\n\nAll right, Pudge. We have reached the point in the evening when I\u2019m obliged to go and find my girlfriend. So give me a few of those cigarettes you\u2019ll never smoke anyway and I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d\n\nI decided to hang out on the swing for a while, half because the heat had finally dissipated into a pleasant, if muggy, eighty-something, and half because I thought Alaska might show up. But almost as soon as the Colonel left, the bugs encroached: no-see-ums (which, for the record, you can see) and mosquitoes hovered around me in such numbers that the tiny noise of their rubbing wings sounded cacophonous. And then I decided to smoke.\n\nNow, I did think, The smoke will drive the bugs away. And, to some degree, it did. I\u2019d be lying though if I claimed I became a smoker to ward off insects.\n\nI became a smoker because (1) I was on an Adirondack swing by myself, and (2) I had cigarettes, and (3) I figured that if everyone else could smoke a cigarette without coughing, I could damn well too. In short, I didn\u2019t have a very good reason. So yeah, let\u2019s just say that (4) it was the bugs.\n\nI made it through three entire drags before I felt nauseous and dizzy and only semi-pleasantly buzzed. I got up to leave. As I stood, a voice behind me said:\n\nSo, do you really memorise last words?\u201d\n\nShe ran up beside me and grabbed my shoulder and pushed me back on to the porch swing.\n\nYeah,\u201d I said. And then hesitantly, I added, \u201cYou want to quiz me?\u201d\n\nJFK,\u201d she said.\n\nThat\u2019s obvious,\u201d I answered.\n\nOh, is it now?\u201d she asked.\n\nNo. Those were his last words.\n\nSomeone said, \u2018Mr President, you sure can\u2019t say Dallas doesn\u2019t love you,\u2019 and then he said, \u2018That\u2019s obvious,\u2019 and then he got shot.\u201d\n\nShe laughed. \u201cGod, that\u2019s awful. I shouldn\u2019t laugh. But I will,\u201d and then she laughed again.\n\nOK, Mr Famous Last Words Boy. I have one for you.\u201d She reached into her overstuffed backpack and pulled out a book.\n\nGabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez.\n\nThe General in His Labyrinth.\n\nAbsolutely one of my favourites. It\u2019s about Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar.\u201d I didn\u2019t know who Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar was, but she didn\u2019t give me time to ask. \u201cIt\u2019s a historical novel, so I don\u2019t know if this is true, but in the book, do you know what his last words are?\n\nNo, you don\u2019t. But I am about to tell you, Se\u00f1or Parting Remarks.\u201d\n\nAnd then she lit a cigarette and sucked on it so hard for so long that I thought the entire thing might burn off in one drag. She exhaled and read to me:\n\nHe \u2013 that\u2019s Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar \u2013 was shaken by the overwhelming revelation that the headlong race between his misfortunes and his dreams was at that moment reaching the finish line. The rest was darkness. \u2018Damn it,\u2019 he sighed. \u2018How will I ever get out of this labyrinth?\u2019\u201d\n\nI knew great last words when I heard them, and I made a mental note to get ahold of a biography of this Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar fellow. Beautiful last words, but I didn\u2019t quite understand.\n\nSo what\u2019s the labyrinth?\u201d I asked her.\n\nAnd now is as good a time as any to say that she was beautiful. In the dark beside me, she smelled of sweat and sunshine and vanilla, and on that thin-mooned night I could see little more than her silhouette except for when she smoked, when the burning cherry of the cigarette washed her face in pale red light. But even in the dark, I could see her eyes \u2013 fierce emeralds. She had the kind of eyes that predisposed you to supporting her every endeavour.\n\nAnd not just beautiful, but hot too, with her breasts straining against her tight tank top, her curved legs swinging back and forth beneath the swing, flip-flops dangling from her electric-blue-painted toes.\n\nIt was right then, between when I asked about the labyrinth and when she answered me, that I realised the importance of curves, of the thousand times where girls\u2019 bodies ease from one place to another, from arc of the foot to ankle to calf, from calf to hip to waist to breast to neck to ski-slope nose to forehead to shoulder to the concave arch of the back to the butt to the etc.\n\nI\u2019d noticed curves before, of course, but I had never quite apprehended their significance.\n\nHer mouth close enough to me that I could feel her breath warmer than the air, she said,\n\nThat\u2019s the mystery, isn\u2019t it? Is the labyrinth living or dying? Which is he trying to escape \u2013 the world or the end of it?\u201d I waited for her to keep talking, but after a while it became obvious she wanted an answer.\n\nUh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d I said finally. \u201cHave you really read all those books in your room?\u201d\n\nShe laughed. \u201cOh God, no. I\u2019ve maybe read a third of \u2019em. But I\u2019m going to read them all. I call it my Life\u2019s Library. Every summer since I was little, I\u2019ve gone to garage sales and bought all the books that looked interesting. So I always have something to read. But there is so much to do: cigarettes to smoke, sex to have, swings to swing on. I\u2019ll have more time for reading when I\u2019m old and boring.\u201d\n\nShe told me that I reminded her of the Colonel when he came to Culver Creek. They were freshmen together, she said, both scholarship kids with, as she put it, \u201ca shared interest in booze and mischief\u201d. The phrase booze and mischief left me worrying I\u2019d stumbled into what my mother referred to as \u201cthe wrong crowd\u201d, but for the wrong crowd, they both seemed awfully smart.\n\nAs she lit a new cigarette off the butt of her previous one, she told me that the Colonel was smart but hadn\u2019t done much living when he got to the Creek.\n\nI got rid of that problem quickly.\u201d She smiled.\n\nBy November, I\u2019d gotten him his first girlfriend, a perfectly nice non-Weekday Warrior named Janice. He dumped her after a month because she was too rich for his poverty-soaked blood, but whatever.\n\nWe pulled our first prank that year \u2013 we filled Classroom 4 with a thin layer of marbles. We\u2019ve progressed some since then, of course.\u201d She laughed. So Chip became the Colonel \u2013 the military-style planner of their pranks \u2013 and Alaska was ever Alaska, the larger-than-life creative force behind them.\n\nYou\u2019re smart like him,\u201d she said. \u201cQuieter, though. And cuter, but I didn\u2019t even just say that, because I love my boyfriend.\u201d\n\nYeah, you\u2019re not bad either,\u201d I said, overwhelmed by her compliment, \u201cBut I didn\u2019t just say that, because I love my girlfriend. Oh, wait. Right. I don\u2019t have one.\u201d\n\nShe laughed. \u201cYeah, don\u2019t worry, Pudge. If there\u2019s one thing I can get you, it\u2019s a girlfriend. Let\u2019s make a deal: you figure out what the labyrinth is and how to get out of it, and I\u2019ll get you laid.\u201d\n\nDeal.\u201d We shook on it.\n\nLater, I walked towards the dorm circle beside Alaska. The cicadas hummed their one-note song, just as they had at home in Florida. She turned to me as we made our way through the darkness and said, \u201cWhen you\u2019re walking at night, do you ever get creeped out and even though it\u2019s silly and embarrassing you just want to run home?\u201d\n\nIt seemed too secret and personal to admit to a virtual stranger, but I told her, \u201cYeah, totally.\u201d\n\nFor a moment, she was quiet. Then she grabbed my hand, whispered, \u201cRun run run run run,\u201d and took off, pulling me behind her.\n\nOne Hundred and Twenty-seven Days Before\n\nEarly the next afternoon, I blinked sweat from my eyes as I taped a Van Gogh poster to the back of the door. The Colonel sat on the couch judging whether the poster was level and fielding my endless questions about Alaska.\n\nWhat\u2019s her story? \u201cShe\u2019s from Vine Station. You could drive past it without noticing \u2013 and from what I understand, you ought to. Her boyfriend\u2019s at Vanderbilt on scholarship. Plays bass in some band. Don\u2019t know much about her family.\u201d\n\nSo she really likes him? \u201cI guess. She hasn\u2019t cheated on him, which is a first.\u201d And so on. All morning, I\u2019d been unable to care about anything else, not the Van Gogh poster and not video games and not even my class schedule, which the Eagle had brought by that morning. He introduced himself too:\n\nWelcome to Culver Creek, Mr Halter. You\u2019re given a large measure of freedom here. If you abuse it, you\u2019ll regret it. You seem like a nice young man. I\u2019d hate to have to bid you farewell.\u201d\n\nAnd then he stared at me in a manner that was either serious or seriously malicious. \u201cAlaska calls that the Look of Doom,\u201d the Colonel told me after the Eagle left. \u201cThe next time you see that, you\u2019re busted.\u201d\n\nOK, Pudge,\u201d the Colonel said as I stepped away from the poster. Not entirely level, but close enough.\n\nEnough with the Alaska already.\n\nBy my count, there are ninety-two girls at this school and every last one of them is less crazy than Alaska, who, I might add, already has a boyfriend. I\u2019m going to lunch. It\u2019s bufriedo day.\u201d\n\nHe walked out, leaving the door open. Feeling like an over-infatuated idiot, I got up to close the door. The Colonel, already halfway across the dorm circle, turned around.\n\nChrist. Are you coming or what?\u201d\n\nYou can say a lot of bad things about Alabama, but you can\u2019t say that Alabamans as a people are unduly afraid of deep fryers. In that first week at the Creek, the cafeteria served fried chicken, chicken-fried steak and fried okra, which marked my first foray into the delicacy that is the fried vegetable. I half expected them to fry the iceberg lettuce. But nothing matched the bufriedo, a dish created by Maureen, the amazingly (and understandably) obese Culver Creek cook.\n\nA deep-fried bean burrito, the bufriedo proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that frying always improves a food. Sitting with the Colonel and five guys I didn\u2019t know at a circular table in the cafeteria that afternoon, I sank my teeth into the crunchy shell of my first bufriedo and experienced a culinary orgasm. My mom cooked OK, but I immediately wanted to bring Maureen home with me over Thanksgiving.\n\nThe Colonel introduced me (as \u201cPudge\u201d) to the guys at the wobbly wooden table, but I only registered the name Takumi, whom Alaska had mentioned yesterday. A thin Japanese guy only a few inches taller than the Colonel, Takumi talked with his mouth full as I chewed slowly, savouring the beany crunch.\n\nGod,\u201d Takumi said to me, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing like watching a man eat his first bufriedo.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t say much \u2013 partly because no one asked me any questions and partly because I just wanted to eat as much as I could. But Takumi felt no such modesty \u2013 he could, and did, eat and chew and swallow while talking.\n\nThe lunch discussion centred on the girl who was supposed to have been Alaska\u2019s roommate, Marya, and her boyfriend, Paul, who had been a Weekday Warrior.\n\nThey\u2019d gotten kicked out in the last week of the previous school year, I learned, for what the Colonel called \u201cthe Trifecta\u201d \u2013 they were caught committing three of Culver Creek\u2019s expellable offences at once. Lying naked in bed together (\u201cgenital contact\u201d being offence number one), already drunk (number two), they were smoking a joint (number three) when the Eagle burst in on them. Rumours had it that someone had ratted them out, and Takumi seemed intent on finding out who \u2013 intent enough, anyway, to shout about it with his mouth jampacked with bufriedo.\n\nPaul was an asshole,\u201d the Colonel said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have ratted on them, but anyone who shacks up with a Jaguar-driving Weekday Warrior like Paul deserves what she gets.\u201d\n\nDude,\u201d Takumi responded, \u201cyaw guhfwend,\u201d and then he swallowed a bite of food, \u201cis a Weekday Warrior.\u201d\n\nTrue.\u201d The Colonel laughed. \u201cMuch to my chagrin, that is an incontestable fact. But she is not as big an asshole as Paul.\u201d\n\nNot quite.\u201d Takumi smirked. The Colonel laughed, and I wondered why he wouldn\u2019t stand up for his girlfriend. I wouldn\u2019t have cared if my girlfriend was a Jaguar-driving Cyclops with a beard \u2013 I\u2019d have been grateful just to have someone to make out with.\n\nThat evening, when the Colonel dropped by Room 43 to pick up the cigarettes (he seemed to have forgotten that they were, technically, mine), I didn\u2019t really care when he didn\u2019t invite me out with him.\n\nIn public school, I\u2019d known plenty of people who made it a habit to hate this kind of person or that kind \u2013 the geeks hated the preps, etc \u2013 and it always seemed like a big waste of time to me. The Colonel didn\u2019t tell me where he\u2019d spent the afternoon, or where he was going to spend the evening, but he closed the door behind him when he left, so I guessed I wasn\u2019t welcome.\n\nJust as well: I spent the night surfing the web (no porn, I swear) and reading The Final Days, a book about Richard Nixon and Watergate. For dinner, I microwaved a refrigerated bufriedo the Colonel had snuck out of the cafeteria.\n\nIt reminded me of nights in Florida \u2013 except with better food and no air-conditioning. Lying in bed and reading felt pleasantly familiar.\n\nI decided to heed what I\u2019m sure would have been my mother\u2019s advice and get a good night\u2019s sleep before my first day of classes. French II started at 8.10, and figuring it couldn\u2019t take more than eight minutes to put on some clothes and walk to the classrooms, I set my alarm for 8.02. I took a shower and then lay in bed waiting for sleep to save me from the heat.\n\nAround 11.00, I realised that the tiny fan clipped to my bunk might make more of a difference if I took off my shirt, and I finally fell asleep on top of the sheets wearing just boxers.\n\nA decision I found myself regretting some hours later when I awoke to two sweaty, meaty hands shaking the holy hell out of me.\n\nI woke up completely and instantly, sitting up straight in bed, terrified, and I couldn\u2019t understand the voices for some reason, couldn\u2019t understand why there were any voices at all, and what the hell time was it anyway?\n\nAnd finally my head cleared enough to hear, \u201cC\u2019mon, kid. Don\u2019t make us kick your ass.\n\nJust get up,\u201d and then from the top bunk, I heard, \u201cChrist, Pudge. Just get up.\u201d So I got up and saw for the first time three shadowy figures. Two of them grabbed me, one with a hand on each of my upper arms, and walked me out of the room. On the way out, the Colonel mumbled, \u201cHave a good time.\n\nGo easy on him, Kevin.\u201d\n\nThey led me, almost at a jog, behind my dorm building and then across the soccer field. The ground was grassy but gravelly too, and I wondered why no one had shown the common courtesy to tell me to put on shoes, and why was I out there in my underwear, chicken legs exposed to the world?\n\nA thousand humiliations crossed my mind: There\u2019s the new junior, Miles Halter, handcuffed to the soccer goal wearing only his boxers. I imagined them taking me into the woods, where we now seemed headed, and beating the shit out of me so that I looked great for my first day of school.\n\nAnd the whole time, I just stared at my feet because I didn\u2019t want to look at them and I didn\u2019t want to fall, so I watched my steps, trying to avoid the bigger rocks. I felt the fight-or-flight reflex swell up in me over and over again, but I knew that neither fight nor flight had ever worked for me before.\n\nThey took me a roundabout way to the fake beach, and then I knew what would happen \u2013 a good, old-fashioned dunking in the lake \u2013 and I calmed down. I could handle that.\n\nWhen we reached the beach, they told me to put my arms at my side and the beefiest guy grabbed two rolls of duct tape from the sand. With my arms flat against my sides like a soldier at attention, they mummified me from my shoulder to my wrists.\n\nThen they threw me down on the ground; the sand from the fake beach cushioned the landing, but I still hit my head. Two of them pulled my legs together, while the other one \u2013 Kevin, I\u2019d figured out \u2013 put his angular, strong-jawed face up so close to mine that the gel-soaked spikes of hair pointing out from his forehead poked at my face, and told me, \u201cThis is for the Colonel.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t hang out with that asshole.\u201d They taped my legs together, from ankles to thighs. I looked like a silver mummy. I said, \u201cPlease, guys, don\u2019t,\u201d just before they taped my mouth shut. Then they picked me up and hurled me into the water.\n\nSinking.\n\nSinking, but instead of feeling panic or anything else, it occurred to me that \u201cPlease, guys, don\u2019t\u201d were terrible last words.\n\nBut then the great miracle of the human species \u2013 our buoyancy \u2013 came through, and as I felt myself floating towards the surface, I twisted and turned as best I could so that the warm night air hit my nose first, and I breathed. I wasn\u2019t dead and wasn\u2019t going to die.\n\nWell, I thought, that wasn\u2019t so bad.\n\nBut there was still the small matter of getting to shore before the sun rose. First, to determine my position vis-\u00e0-vis the shoreline. If I tilted my head too much, I felt my whole body start to roll, and on the long list of unpleasant ways to die, \u201cface-down in soaking-wet white boxers\u201d is pretty high up there.\n\nSo instead I rolled my eyes and craned my neck back, my eyes almost underwater, until I saw that the shore \u2013 not ten feet away \u2013 was directly behind my head. I began to swim, an armless silver mermaid, using only my hips to generate motion, until finally my ass scraped against the lake\u2019s mucky bottom. I turned then and used my hips and waist to roll three times, until I came ashore near a ratty green towel. They\u2019d left me a towel. How thoughtful.\n\nThe water had seeped under the duct tape and loosened the adhesive\u2019s grip on my skin, but the tape was wrapped around me three layers deep in places, which necessitated wiggling like a fish out of water. Finally, it loosened enough for me to slip my left hand up and out against my chest and rip the tape off.\n\nI wrapped myself in the sandy towel. I didn\u2019t want to go back to my room and see Chip because I had no idea what Kevin had meant \u2013 maybe if I went back to the room, they\u2019d be waiting for me and they\u2019d get me for real; maybe I needed to show them,\n\nOK. Got your message. He\u2019s just my roommate, not my friend.\u201d And anyway, I didn\u2019t feel terribly friendly towards the Colonel.\n\nHave a good time, he\u2019d said. Yeah, I thought. I had a ball.\n\nSo I went to Alaska\u2019s room. I didn\u2019t know what time it was, but I could see a faint light underneath her door. I knocked softly.\n\nYeah,\u201d she said, and I came in, wet and sandy and only wearing a towel and soaking boxers. This was not, obviously, how you want the world\u2019s hottest girl to see you, but I figured she could explain to me what had just happened.\n\nShe put down a book and got out of bed with a sheet wrapped around her shoulders. For a moment, she looked concerned. She looked like the girl I met yesterday, the girl who said I was cute and bubbled over with energy and silliness and intelligence. And then she laughed.\n\nGuess you went for a swim, huh?\u201d And she said it with such casual malice that I felt that everyone had known, and I wondered why the whole damn school agreed in advance to possibly drown Miles Halter.\n\nBut Alaska liked the Colonel, and in the confusion of the moment, I just looked at her blankly, unsure even of what to ask.\n\nGive me a break,\u201d she said. \u201cCome on. You know what? There are people with real problems I\u2019ve got real problems. Mommy ain\u2019t here, so buck up, big guy.\u201d\n\nI left without saying a word to her and went to my room, slamming the door behind me, waking the Colonel and stomping into the bathroom. I got in the shower to wash the algae and the lake off me, but the ridiculous faucet of a showerhead failed spectacularly, and how could Alaska and Kevin and those other guys already dislike me?\n\nAfter I finished the shower, I dried off and went into the room to find some clothes.\n\nSo,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat took you so long? Get lost on your way home?\u201d\n\nThey said it was because of you\u201d I said, and my voice betrayed a hint of annoyance. \u201cThey said I shouldn\u2019t hang out with you.\u201d\n\nWhat? No, it happens to everybody,\u201d the Colonel said. \u201cIt happened to me. They throw you in the lake. You swim out. You walk home.\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t just swim out,\u201d I said softly, pulling on a pair of jean shorts beneath my towel. \u201cThey duct-taped me. I couldn\u2019t even move really.\u201d\n\nWait. Wait,\u201d he said, and hopped out of his bunk, staring at me through the darkness.\n\nThey taped you? How?\u201d And I showed him: I stood like a mummy, with my feet together and my hands at my sides, and showed him how they\u2019d wrapped me up. And then I plopped down on to the couch.\n\nChrist! You could have drowned! They\u2019re just supposed to throw you in the water in your underwear and run!\u201d he shouted. \u201cWhat the hell were they thinking? Who was it? Kevin Richman and who else? Do you remember their faces?\u201d\n\nYeah, I think.\u201d\n\nWhy the hell would they do that?\u201d he wondered.\n\nDid you do something to them?\u201d I asked.\n\nNo, but I\u2019m sure as shit gonna do something to \u2019em now. We\u2019ll get them.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a big deal. I got out fine.\u201d\n\nYou could have died.\u201d\n\nAnd I could have, I suppose. But I didn\u2019t.\n\nWell, maybe I should just go to the Eagle tomorrow and tell him,\u201d I said.\n\nAbsolutely not,\u201d he answered. He walked over to his crumpled shorts lying on the floor and pulled out a pack of cigarettes. He lit two and handed one to me. I smoked the whole goddamned thing.\n\nYou\u2019re not,\u201d he continued, \u201cbecause that\u2019s not how shit gets dealt with here. And besides, you really don\u2019t want to get a reputation for ratting. But we will deal with those bastards, Pudge. I promise you. They will regret messing with one of my friends.\u201d\n\nAnd if the Colonel thought that calling me his friend would make me stand by him, well, he was right. \u201cAlaska was kind of mean to me tonight,\u201d I said. I leaned over, opened an empty desk drawer and used it as a makeshift ashtray.\n\nLike I said, she\u2019s moody.\u201d\n\nI went to bed wearing a T-shirt, shorts and socks. No matter how miserably hot it got, I resolved, I would sleep in my clothes every night at the Creek, feeling \u2013 probably for the first time in my life \u2013 the fear and excitement of living in a place where you never know what\u2019s going to happen or when.\n\nOne Hundred and Twenty-six Days Before\n\nWell, now it\u2019s war,\u201d the Colonel shouted the next morning. I rolled over and looked at the clock: 7.52. My first Culver Creek class, French, started in eighteen minutes. I blinked a couple of times and looked up at the Colonel, who was standing between the couch and the COFFEE TABLE, holding his well-worn, once-white tennis shoes by the laces.\n\nFor a long time, he stared at me and I stared at him. And then, almost in slow motion, a grin crept across the Colonel\u2019s face.\n\nI\u2019ve got to hand it to them,\u201d he said finally. \u201cThat was pretty clever.\u201d\n\nWhat?\u201d I asked.\n\nLast night \u2013 before they woke you up, I guess \u2013 they pissed in my shoes.\u201d\n\nAre you sure?\u201d I said, trying not to laugh.\n\nDo you care to smell?\u201d he asked, holding the shoes towards me. \u201cBecause I went ahead and smelled them, and yes, I am sure. If there\u2019s one thing I know, it\u2019s when I\u2019ve just stepped in another man\u2019s piss. It\u2019s like my mom always says: \u2018Ya think you\u2019s a walkin\u2019 on water, but turns out you just got piss in your shoes.\u2019\n\nPoint those guys out to me if you see them today,\u201d he added, \u201cbecause we need to figure out why they\u2019re so, uh, pissed at me. And then we need to go ahead and start thinking about how we\u2019re going to ruin their miserable little lives.\u201d\n\nWhen I received the Culver Creek Handbook over the summer and noticed happily that the \u201cDress Code\u201d section contained only two words, casual modesty, it never occurred to me that girls would show up for class half asleep in cotton pyjama shorts, T-shirts and flip-flops. Modest, I guess, and casual.\n\nAnd there was something about girls wearing pyjamas (even if modest) which might have made French at 8.10 in the morning bearable, if I\u2019d had any idea what Madame O\u2019Malley was talking about.\n\nComment dis-tu \u201cOh my God, I don\u2019t know nearly enough French to pass French II\u201d en fran\u00e7ais? My French I class back in Florida did not prepare me for Madame O\u2019Malley, who skipped the \u201chow was your summer\u201d pleasantries and dived directly into something called the pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9, which is apparently a verb tense.\n\nAlaska sat directly across from me in the circle of desks, but she didn\u2019t look at me once the entire class, even though I could notice little but her.\n\nMaybe she could be mean \u2026 but the way she talked that first night about getting out of the labyrinth \u2013 so smart. And the way her mouth curled up on the right side all the time, like she was preparing to smirk, like she\u2019d mastered the right half of the Mona Lisa\u2019s inimitable smile \u2026\n\nFrom my room, the student population seemed manageable, but it overwhelmed me in the classroom area, which was a single, long building just beyond the dorm circle. The building was split into fourteen rooms facing out towards the lake.\n\nKids crammed the narrow sidewalks in front of the classrooms, and even though finding my classes wasn\u2019t hard (even with my poor sense of direction, I could get from French in Room 3 to precalc in Room 12), I felt unsettled all day. I didn\u2019t know anyone and couldn\u2019t even figure out whom I should be trying to know, and the classes were hard, even on the first day.\n\nMy dad had told me I\u2019d have to study and now I believed him. The teachers were serious and smart and a lot of them went by \u201cDr\u201d and so when the  time came for my last class before lunch, World Religions, I felt tremendous relief.\n\nA vestige from when Culver Creek was a Christian boys\u2019 school, I figured the World Religions class, required of every junior and senior, might be an easy A.\n\nIt was my only class all day where the desks weren\u2019t arranged either in a square or a circle, so, not wanting to seem eager, I sat down in the third row at 11.03. I was seven minutes early, partly because I liked to be punctual, and partly because I didn\u2019t have anyone to chat with out in the halls. Shortly thereafter, the Colonel came in with Takumi and they sat down on opposite sides of me.\n\nI heard about last night,\u201d Takumi said. \u201cAlaska\u2019s pissed.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s weird, since she was such a bitch last night,\u201d I blurted out.\n\nTakumi just shook his head. \u201cYeah, well, she didn\u2019t know the whole story. And people are moody, dude. You gotta get used to living with people. You could have worse friends than\u2014\u201d\n\nThe Colonel cut him off. \u201cEnough with the psychobabble, MC Dr Phil. Let\u2019s talk counter-insurgency.\u201d People were starting to file into class, so the Colonel leaned in towards me and whispered, \u201cIf any of \u2019em are in this class, let me know, OK? Just, here, just put X\u2019s where they\u2019re sitting,\u201d and he ripped a sheet of paper out of his notebook and drew a square for each desk.\n\nAs people filed in, I saw one of them \u2013 the tall one with immaculately spiky hair \u2013 Kevin. Kevin stared down the Colonel as he walked past, but in trying to stare, he forgot to watch his step and bumped his thigh against a desk. The Colonel laughed. One of the other guys, the one who was either a little fat or worked out too much, came in behind Kevin, sporting pleated khaki pants and a short sleeve black polo shirt.\n\nAs they sat down, I crossed through the appropriate squares on the Colonel\u2019s diagram and handed it to him. Just then, the Old Man shuffled in.\n\nHe breathed slowly and with great labour through his wide-open mouth. He took tiny steps towards the lectern, his heels not moving much past his toes.\n\nThe Colonel nudged me and pointed casually to his notebook, which read, The Old Man only has one lung, and I did not doubt it. His audible, almost desperate breaths reminded me of my grandfather when he was dying of lung cancer. Barrel-chested and ancient, the Old Man, it seemed to me, might die before he ever reached the podium.\n\nMy name,\u201d he said, \u201cis Dr Hyde. I have a first name, of course. So far as you are concerned, it is Doctor.\n\nYour parents pay a great deal of money so that you can attend school here, and I expect that you will offer them some return on their investment by reading what I tell you to read when I tell you to read it and consistently attending this class. And when you are here, you will listen to what I say.\u201d Clearly not an easy A.\n\nThis year, we\u2019ll be studying three religious traditions: Islam, Christianity and Buddhism. We\u2019ll tackle three more traditions next year. And in my classes, I will talk most of the time and you will listen most of the time, because you may be smart.\n\nBut I\u2019ve been smart longer. I\u2019m sure some of you do not like lecture classes, but as you have probably noted, I\u2019m not as young as I used to be.\n\nI would love to spend my remaining breath chatting with you about the finer points of Islamic history, but our time together is short. I must talk and you must listen, for we are engaged here in the most important pursuit in history: the search for meaning.\n\nWhat is the nature of being a person?\n\nWhat is the best way to go about being a person? How did we come to be, and what will become of us when we are no longer? In short: what are the rules of this game and how might we best play it?\u201d\n\nThe nature of the labyrinth, I scribbled into my spiral notebook, and the way out of it. This teacher rocked. I hated discussion classes. I hated talking, and I hated listening to everyone else stumble on their words and try to phrase things in the vaguest possible way so they wouldn\u2019t sound dumb, and I hated how it was all just a game of trying to figure out what the teacher wanted to hear and then saying it. I\u2019m in class, so teach me.\n\nAnd teach me he did: in those fifty minutes, the Old Man made me take religion seriously. I\u2019d never been religious, but he told us that religion is important whether or not we believed in one, in the same way that historical events are important whether or not you personally lived through them. And then he assigned us fifty pages of reading for the next day \u2013 from a book called Religious Studies.\n\nThat afternoon, I had two classes and two free periods. We had nine fifty-minute class periods each day, which means that most everyone had three \u201cstudy periods\u201d (except for the Colonel, who had an extra independent-study math class on account of being an Extra Special Genius).\n\nThe Colonel and I had biology together, where I pointed out the other guy who\u2019d duct-taped me the night before.\n\nIn the top corner of his notebook, the Colonel wrote, Longwell Chase. Senior W-day Warrior. Friends w/Sara. Weird. It took me a minute to remember who Sara was: the Colonel\u2019s girlfriend.\n\nI spent my free periods in my room trying to read about religion. I learned that myth doesn\u2019t mean a lie; it means a traditional story that tells you something about people and their worldview and what they hold sacred. Interesting. I also learned that after the events of the previous night, I was far too tired to care about myths or anything else, so I slept on top of the covers for most of the afternoon, until I awoke to Alaska singing,\n\nWAKE UP, LITTLE PUHHHHHDGIE!\u201d directly into my left ear canal. I held the religion book close up against my chest like a small paperback security blanket.\n\nThat was terrible,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat do I need to do to ensure that never happens to me again?\u201d\n\nNothing you can do!\u201d she said excitedly. \u201cI\u2019m unpredictable. God, don\u2019t you hate Dr Hyde? Don\u2019t you? He\u2019s so condescending.\u201d\n\nI sat up and said, \u201cI think he\u2019s a genius,\u201d partly because I thought it was true and partly because I just felt like disagreeing with her.\n\nShe sat down on the bed. \u201cDo you always sleep in your clothes?\u201d\n\nYup.\u201d\n\nFunny,\u201d she said. \u201cYou weren\u2019t wearing much last night.\u201d I just glared at her.\n\nC\u2019mon, Pudge. I\u2019m teasing. You have to be tough here. I didn\u2019t know how bad it was \u2013 and I\u2019m sorry and they\u2019ll regret it \u2013 but you have to be tough.\u201d And then she left. That was all she had to say on the subject. She\u2019s cute, I thought, but you don\u2019t need to like a girl who treats you like you\u2019re ten: you\u2019ve already got a mom.\n\nOne Hundred and Twenty-two Days Before\n\nAfter my last class of my first week at Culver Creek, I entered Room 43 to an unlikely sight: the diminutive and shirtless Colonel, hunched over an ironing board, attacking a pink button-down shirt.\n\nSweat trickled down his forehead and chest as he ironed with great enthusiasm, his right arm pushing the iron across the length of the shirt with such vigour that his breathing nearly mirrored Dr Hyde\u2019s.\n\nI have a date,\u201d he explained. \u201cThis is an emergency.\u201d He paused to catch his breath. \u201cDo you know \u2026\u201d breath \u201c\u2026 how to iron?\u201d\n\nI walked over to the pink shirt. It was wrinkled like an old woman who spent her youth sunbathing. If only the Colonel didn\u2019t ball up his every belonging and stuff it into random drawers. \u201cI think you just turn it on and press it against the shirt, right?\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t even know we had an iron.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t. It\u2019s Takumi\u2019s. But Takumi doesn\u2019t know how to iron either.\n\nAnd when I asked Alaska, she started yelling, \u2018You\u2019re not going to impose the patriarchal paradigm on me.\u2019 Oh, God, I need to smoke. I need to smoke but I can\u2019t reek when I see Sara\u2019s parents.\n\nOK, screw it. We\u2019re going to smoke in the bathroom with the shower on. The shower has steam. Steam gets rid of wrinkles, right?\u201d\n\nBy the way,\u201d he said as I followed him into the bathroom, \u201cIf you want to smoke inside during the day, just turn on the shower. The smoke follows the steam up the vents.\u201d\n\nThough this made no scientific sense, it seemed to work. The shower\u2019s shortage of water pressure and low showerhead made it all but useless for showering, but it worked great as a smoke screen.\n\nSadly, it made a poor iron. The Colonel tried ironing the shirt once more (\u201cI\u2019m just gonna push really hard and see if that helps\u201d) and finally put it on wrinkled. He matched the shirt with a blue tie decorated with horizontal lines of little pink flamingos.\n\nThe one thing my lousy father taught me,\u201d the Colonel said as his hands nimbly threaded the tie into a perfect knot, \u201cwas how to tie a tie. Which is odd, since I can\u2019t imagine when he ever had to wear one.\u201d\n\nJust then, Sara knocked on the door. I\u2019d seen her once or twice before, but the Colonel never introduced me to her and didn\u2019t have a chance to that night.\n\nOh. My. God. Can\u2019t you at least press your shirt?\u201d she asked, even though the Colonel was standing in front of the ironing board.\n\nWe\u2019re going out with my parents.\u201d Sara looked awfully nice in her blue summer dress. Her long, pale blonde hair was pulled up into a twist, with a strand of hair falling down each side of her face. She looked like a movie star \u2013 a bitchy one.\n\nLook, I did my best. We don\u2019t all have maids to do our ironing.\u201d\n\nChip, that chip on your shoulder makes you look even shorter.\u201d\n\nChrist, can\u2019t we get out the door without fighting?\u201d\n\nI\u2019m just saying. It\u2019s the opera. It\u2019s a big deal to my parents. Whatever. Let\u2019s go.\u201d I felt like leaving, but it seemed stupid to hide in the bathroom, and Sara was standing in the doorway, one hand cocked on her hip and the other fiddling with her car keys.\n\nI could wear a tuxedo and your parents would still hate me!\u201d he shouted.\n\nThat\u2019s not my fault! You antagonise them!\u201d She held up the car keys in front of him. \u201cLook, we\u2019re going now or we\u2019re not going.\u201d\n\nFuck it. I\u2019m not going anywhere with you,\u201d the Colonel said.\n\nFine. Have a great night,\u201d Sara slammed the door so hard that a sizeable biography of Leo Tolstoy (last words: \u201cThe truth is \u2026 I care a great deal \u2026 what they \u2026\u201d) fell off my bookshelf and landed with a thud on our chequered floor like an echo of the slamming door.\n\nAHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d he screamed.\n\nSo that\u2019s Sara,\u201d I said.\n\nYes.\u201d\n\nShe seems nice.\u201d\n\nThe Colonel laughed, knelt down next to the minifridge and pulled out a gallon of milk. He opened it, took a swig, winced, half-coughed and sat down on the couch with the milk between his legs.\n\nIs it sour or something?\u201d\n\nOh, I should have mentioned that earlier. This isn\u2019t milk. It\u2019s five parts milk and one part vodka. I call it ambrosia. Drink of the gods. You can barely smell the vodka in the milk, so the Eagle can\u2019t catch me unless he actually takes a sip.\n\nThe downside is that it tastes like sour milk and rubbing alcohol, but it\u2019s Friday night, Pudge, and my girlfriend is a bitch. Want some?\u201d\n\nI think I\u2019ll pass.\u201d Aside from a few sips of champagne on New Year\u2019s under the watchful eye of my parents, I\u2019d never really drunk any alcohol, and \u201cambrosia\u201d didn\u2019t seem like the drink with which to start.\n\nOutside, I heard the payphone ring. Given the fact that 190 boarders share five payphones, I was amazed how infrequently it rang. We weren\u2019t supposed to have cell phones, but I\u2019d noticed that some of the Weekday Warriors carried them surreptitiously. And most non-Warriors called their parents, as I did, on a regular basis, so parents only called when their kids forgot.\n\nAre you going to get that?\u201d the Colonel asked me. I didn\u2019t feel like being bossed around by him, but I also didn\u2019t feel like fighting.\n\nThrough a buggy twilight, I walked to the payphone, which was drilled into the wall between Rooms 44 and 45. On both sides of the phone, dozens of phone numbers and esoteric notes were written in pen and marker (205.555.1584; Tommy to airport 4:20; 773.573.6521; JG \u2013 Kuffs?). Calling the payphone required a great deal of patience. I picked up on about the ninth ring.\n\nCan you get Chip for me?\u201d Sara asked. It sounded like she was on a cell phone.\n\nYeah, hold on.\u201d\n\nI turned and he was already behind me, as if he knew it would be her. I handed him the receiver and walked back to the room.\n\nA minute later, three words made their way to our room through the thick, still air of Alabama at almost-night. \u201cScrew you too!\u201d the Colonel shouted.\n\nBack in the room, he sat down with his ambrosia and told me, \u201cShe says I ratted out Paul and Marya. That\u2019s what the Warriors are saying. That I ratted them out. Me. That\u2019s why the piss in the shoes. That\u2019s why the nearly killing you. \u2019Cause you live with me and they say I\u2019m a rat.\u201d\n\nI tried to remember who Paul and Marya were. The names were familiar, but I\u2019d heard so many names in the last week, and I couldn\u2019t match \u201cPaul\u201d and \u201cMarya\u201d with faces. And then I remembered why: I\u2019d never seen them. They got kicked out the year before, having committed the Trifecta.\n\nHow long have you been dating her?\u201d I asked.\n\nNine months. We never got along. I mean, I didn\u2019t even briefly like her. Like, my mom and my dad \u2013 my dad would get pissed and then he would beat the shit out of my mom. And then my dad would be all nice and they\u2019d have like a honeymoon period. But with Sara, there\u2019s never a honeymoon period.\n\nGod, how could she think I was a rat? I know, I know: why don\u2019t we break up?\u201d He ran a hand through his hair, clutching a fistful of it atop his head, and said, \u201cI guess I stay with her because she stays with me. And that\u2019s not an easy thing to do. I\u2019m a bad boyfriend. She\u2019s a bad girlfriend. We deserve one another.\u201d\n\nBut\u2014\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t believe they think that,\u201d he said as he walked to the bookshelf and pulled down the almanac. He took a long pull of his ambrosia.\n\nGoddamn Weekday Warriors. It was probably one of them that ratted out Paul and Marya and then blamed me to cover their tracks. Anyway, it\u2019s a good night for staying in. Staying in with Pudge and ambrosia.\u201d\n\nI still\u2014\u201d I said, wanting to say that I didn\u2019t understand how you could kiss someone who believed you were a rat if being a rat was the worst thing in the world, but the Colonel cut me off.\n\nNot another word about it. You know what the capital of Sierra Leone is?\u201d\n\nNo.\u201d\n\nMe neither,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I intend to find out.\u201d And with that, he stuck his nose in the almanac and the conversation was over.\n\nOne Hundred and Ten Days Before\n\nKeeping up with my classes proved easier than I\u2019d expected. My general predisposition to spending a lot of time inside reading gave me a distinct advantage over the average Culver Creek student.\n\nBy the third week of classes, plenty of kids had been sunburnt to a bufriedo-like golden brown from days spent chatting outside in the shadeless dorm circle during free periods. But I was barely pink: I studied.\n\nAnd I listened in class too, but on that Wednesday morning, when Dr Hyde started talking about how Buddhists believe that all things are interconnected, I found myself staring out the window. I was looking at the wooded, slow-sloping hill beyond the lake.\n\nAnd from Hyde\u2019s classroom, things did seem connected: the trees seemed to clothe the hill, and just as I would never think to notice a particular cotton thread in the magnificently tight orange tank top Alaska wore that day, I couldn\u2019t see the trees for the forest \u2013 everything so intricately woven together that it made no sense to think of one tree as independent from that hill. And then I heard my name and I knew I was in trouble.\n\nMr Halter,\u201d the Old Man said, \u201chere I am, straining my lungs for your edification. And yet something out there seems to have caught your fancy in a way that I\u2019ve been unable to do. Pray tell: what have you discovered out there?\u201d\n\nNow I felt my own breath shorten, the whole class watching me, thanking God they weren\u2019t me. Dr Hyde had already done this three times, kicking kids out of class for not paying attention or writing notes to one another.\n\nUm, I was just looking outside at the, uh, at the hill and thinking about um the trees and the forest, like you were saying earlier, about the way\u2014\u201d\n\nThe Old Man, who obviously did not tolerate vocalised rambling, cut me off. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask you to leave class, Mr Halter, so that you can go out there and discover the relationship between the um-trees and the uh-forest. And tomorrow, when you\u2019re ready to take this class seriously, I will welcome you back.\u201d\n\nI sat still, my pen resting in my hand, my notebook open, my face flushed and my jaw jutting out into an underbite, an old trick I had to keep from looking sad or scared. Two rows behind me, I heard a chair move and turned around to see Alaska standing up, slinging her backpack over one arm.\n\nI\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s bullshit. You can\u2019t just throw him out of class. You drone on and on for an hour every day and we\u2019re not allowed to glance out the window?\u201d\n\nThe Old Man stared back at Alaska like a bull at a matador, then raised a hand to his sagging face and slowly rubbed the white stubble on his cheek.\n\nFor fifty minutes a day, five days a week, you abide by my rules. Or you fail. The choice is yours. Both of you leave.\u201d\n\nI stuffed my notebook into my backpack and walked out, humiliated. As the door shut behind me, I felt a tap on my left shoulder. I turned, but there was no one there. Then I turned the other way and Alaska was smiling at me, the skin between her eyes and temple crinkled into a starburst. \u201cThe oldest trick in the book,\u201d she said, \u201cbut everybody falls for it.\u201d\n\nI tried a smile, but I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Dr Hyde. It was worse than the duct tape incident, because I always knew that the Kevin Richmans of the world didn\u2019t like me. But my teachers had always been card-carrying members of the Miles Halter Fan Club.\n\nI told you he was an asshole,\u201d she said.\n\nI still think he\u2019s a genius. He\u2019s right. I wasn\u2019t listening.\u201d\n\nRight, but he didn\u2019t need to be a jerk about it. Like he needs to prove his power by humiliating you?! Anyway,\u201d she said, \u201cthe only real geniuses are artists. Yeats, Picasso, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez: geniuses. Dr Hyde: bitter old man.\u201d\n\nAnd then she announced we were going to look for four-leaf clovers until class ended and we could go smoke with the Colonel and Takumi, \u201cboth of whom,\u201d she added, \u201care big-time assholes for not marching out of class right behind us.\u201d\n\nWhen Alaska Young is sitting with her legs crossed in a brittle, periodically green clover patch leaning forward in search of four-leaf clovers, the pale skin of her sizeable cleavage clearly visible, it is a plain fact of human physiology that it becomes impossible to join in her clover search. I\u2019d gotten in enough trouble already for looking where I wasn\u2019t supposed to, but still \u2026\n\nAfter perhaps two minutes of combing through a clover patch with her long, dirty fingernails, Alaska grabbed a clover with three full-size petals and an undersize runt of a fourth, and looked up at me, barely giving me time to avert my eyes.\n\nEven though you were clearly not doing your part in the clover search, Perv,\u201d she said wryly, \u201cI really would give you this clover. Except luck is for suckers.\u201d She pinched the runt petal between the nails of her thumb and finger and plucked it.\n\nThere,\u201d she said to the clover as she dropped it on to the ground. \u201cNow you\u2019re not a genetic freak any more.\u201d\n\nUh, thanks,\u201d I said. The bell rang and Takumi and the Colonel were first out the door. Alaska stared at them.\n\nWhat?\u201d asked the Colonel. But she just rolled her eyes and started walking. We followed in silence through the dorm circle and then across the soccer field. We ducked into the woods, following the faint path around the lake until we came to a dirt road.\n\nThe Colonel ran up to Alaska, and they started fighting about something quietly enough that I couldn\u2019t hear the words so much as the mutual annoyance, and I finally asked Takumi where we were headed.\n\nThis road dead-ends into the barn,\u201d he said. \u201cSo maybe there. But probably the Smoking Hole. You\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nFrom here, the woods were a totally different creature than from Dr Hyde\u2019s classroom. The ground was thick with fallen branches, decaying pine needles and brambly green bushes; the path wound past pine trees sprouting tall and thin, their stubbly needles providing a lace of shade from another sunburnt day.\n\nAnd the smaller oak and maple trees, which from Dr Hyde\u2019s classroom had been invisible beneath the more majestic pines, showed hints of an as-yet-thermally-unforeseeable fall: their still-green leaves were beginning to droop.\n\nWe came to a rickety wooden bridge \u2013 just thick plywood laid over a concrete foundation \u2013 over Culver Creek, the winding rivulet that doubled back over and over again through the outskirts of campus. On the far side of the bridge, there was a tiny path leading down a steep slope. Not even a path so much as a series of hints \u2013 a broken branch here, a patch of stomped-down grass there \u2013 that people had come this way before.\n\nAs we walked down single file, Alaska, the Colonel and Takumi each held back a thick maple branch for one another, passing it along until I, last in line, let it snap back into place behind me. And there, beneath the bridge, an oasis.\n\nA slab of concrete, three feet wide and ten feet long, with three blue plastic chairs stolen long ago from some classroom. Cooled by the creek and the shade of the bridge, I felt unhot for the first time in weeks.\n\nThe Colonel dispensed the cigarettes. Takumi passed; the rest of us lit up.\n\nHe has no right to condescend to us is all I\u2019m saying,\u201d Alaska said, continuing her conversation with the Colonel. \u201cPudge is done with staring out the window, and I\u2019m done with going on tirades about it, but he\u2019s a terrible teacher and you won\u2019t convince me otherwise.\u201d\n\nFine,\u201d the Colonel said. \u201cJust don\u2019t make another scene. Christ, you nearly killed the poor old bastard.\u201d\n\nSeriously, you\u2019ll never win by crossing Hyde,\u201d Takumi said. \u201cHe\u2019ll eat you alive, shit you out and then piss on his dump. Which by the way is what we should be doing to whoever ratted on Marya. Has anyone heard anything?\u201d\n\nIt must have been some Weekday Warrior,\u201d Alaska said.\n\nBut apparently they think it was the Colonel. So who knows. Maybe the Eagle just got lucky. She was stupid; she got caught; she got expelled; it\u2019s over. That\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re stupid and you get caught.\u201d Alaska made an O with her lips, moving her mouth like a goldfish eating, trying unsuccessfully to blow smoke rings.\n\nWow,\u201d Takumi said, \u201cif I ever get kicked out, remind me to even the score myself, since I sure can\u2019t count on you.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d she responded, not angry so much as dismissive. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re so obsessed with figuring out everything that happens here, like we have to unravel every mystery. God, it\u2019s over. Takumi, you gotta stop stealing other people\u2019s problems and get some of your own.\u201d Takumi started up again, but Alaska raised her hand as if to swat the conversation away.\n\nI said nothing \u2013 I hadn\u2019t known Marya, and anyway, \u201clistening quietly\u201d was my general social strategy.\n\nAnyway,\u201d Alaska said to me. \u201cI thought the way he treated you was just awful. I wanted to cry. I just wanted to kiss you and make it better.\u201d\n\nShame you didn\u2019t,\u201d I deadpanned, and they laughed.\n\nYou\u2019re adorable,\u201d she said, and I felt the intensity of her eyes on me and looked away nervously. \u201cToo bad I love my boyfriend.\u201d I stared at the knotted roots of the trees on the creek bank, trying hard not to look like I\u2019d just been called adorable.\n\nTakumi couldn\u2019t believe it either and he walked over to me, tussling my hair with his hand, and started rapping to Alaska. \u201cYeah, Pudge is adorable / but you want incorrigible / so Jake is more endurable / \u2019cause he\u2019s so\u2014 damn. Damn! I almost had four rhymes on adorable. But all I could think of was unfloorable, which isn\u2019t even a word.\u201d\n\nAlaska laughed. \u201cThat made me not be mad at you any more. God, rapping is sexy. Pudge, did you even know that you\u2019re in the presence of the sickest emcee in Alabama?\u201d\n\nUm, no.\u201d\n\nDrop a beat, Colonel Catastrophe,\u201d Takumi said, and I laughed at the idea that a guy as short and dorky as the Colonel could have a rap name. The Colonel cupped his hands around his mouth and started making some absurd noises that I suppose were intended to be beats. Puh-chi. Puh-puhpuh-chi. Takumi laughed.\n\nRight here, by the river, you want me to kick it? / If your smoke was a popsicle, I\u2019d surely lick it / My rhymin\u2019 is old school, sort of like the ancient Romans / The Colonel\u2019s beats is sad like Arthur Miller\u2019s Willy Loman / Sometimes I\u2019m accused of being a showman / ICanRhymeFast and I can rhyme slow, man.\u201d\n\nHe paused, took a breath and then finished.\n\nLike Emily Dickinson, I ain\u2019t afraid of slant rhyme / And that\u2019s the end of this verse; emcee\u2019s out on a high.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t know slant rhyme from regular rhyme, but I was suitably impressed. We gave Takumi a soft round of applause. Alaska finished her cigarette and flicked it into the river.\n\nWhy do you smoke so damn fast?\u201d I asked.\n\nShe looked at me and smiled widely, and such a wide smile on her narrow face might have looked goofy were it not for the unimpeachably elegant green in her eyes. She smiled with all the delight of a kid on Christmas morning and said, \u201cY\u2019all smoke to enjoy it. I smoke to die.\u201d\n\nOne Hundred and Nine Days Before\n\nDinner in the cafeteria the next night was meat loaf, one of the rare dishes that didn\u2019t arrive deep-fried and, perhaps as a result, meat loaf was Maureen\u2019s greatest failure \u2013 a stringy, gravy-soaked concoction that did not much resemble a loaf and did not much taste like meat.\n\nAlthough I\u2019d never ridden in it, Alaska apparently had a car and she offered to drive the Colonel and me to McDonald\u2019s, but the Colonel didn\u2019t have any money and I didn\u2019t have much either, what with constantly paying for his extravagant cigarette habit.\n\nSo instead the Colonel and I reheated two-day-old bufriedos \u2013 unlike, say, French fries, a microwaved bufriedo lost nothing of its taste or its satisfying crunch \u2013 after which the Colonel insisted on attending the Creek\u2019s first basketball game of the season.\n\nBasketball in the fall?\u201d I asked the Colonel. \u201cI don\u2019t know much about sports, but isn\u2019t that when you play football?\u201d\n\nThe schools in our league are too small to have football teams, so we play basketball in the fall. Although, man, the Culver Creek football team would be a thing of beauty. Your scrawny ass could probably start at lineman. Anyway, the basketball games are great.\u201d\n\nI hated sports. I hated sports, and I hated people who played them, and I hated people who watched them, and I hated people who didn\u2019t hate people who watched or played them. In third grade \u2013 the very last year that one could play T-ball \u2013 my mother wanted me to make friends, so she forced me on to the Orlando Pirates. I made friends all right \u2013 with a bunch of kindergartners, which didn\u2019t really bolster my social standing with my peers.\n\nPrimarily because I towered over the rest of the players, I nearly made it on to the T-Ball all-star team that year. The kid who beat me, Clay Wurtzel, had one arm. I was an unusually tall third-grader with two arms and I got beat out by kindergartner Clay Wurtzel.\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t some pity-the-one-armed kid thing, either.\n\nClay Wurtzel could flat-out hit whereas I sometimes struck out even with the ball sitting on the tee. One of the things that appealed to me most about Culver Creek was that my dad assured me there was no PE requirement.\n\nThere is only one time when I put aside my passionate hatred for the Weekday Warriors and their country-club bullshit,\u201d the Colonel told me, \u201cand that\u2019s when they pump up the air-conditioning in the gym for a little old-fashioned Culver Creek basketball. You can\u2019t miss the first game of the year.\u201d\n\nAs we walked towards the airplane hangar of a gym, which I had seen but never even thought to approach, the Colonel explained to me the most important thing about our basketball team: they were not very good.\n\nThe \u201cstar\u201d of the team, the Colonel said, was a senior named Hank Walsten, who played power forward despite being five foot eight.\n\nHank\u2019s primary claim to campus fame, I already knew, was that he always had weed, and the Colonel told me that for four years, Hank started every game without ever once playing sober.\n\nHe loves weed like Alaska loves sex,\u201d the Colonel said. \u201cThis is a man who once constructed a bong using only the barrel of an air rifle, a ripe pear and an eight-by-ten glossy photograph of Anna Kournikova. Not the brightest gem in the jewellery shop, but you\u2019ve got to admire his single-minded dedication to drug abuse.\u201d\n\nFrom Hank, the Colonel told me, it went downhill until you reached Wilson Carbod, the starting centre, who was almost six feet tall. \u201cWe\u2019re so bad,\u201d the Colonel said, \u201cwe don\u2019t even have a mascot. I call us the Culver Creek Nothings.\u201d\n\nSo they just suck?\u201d I asked. I didn\u2019t quite understand the point of watching your terrible team get walloped, though the air-conditioning was reason enough for me.\n\nOh, they suck,\u201d the Colonel replied. \u201cBut we always beat the shit out of the deaf-and-blind school.\u201d Apparently, basketball wasn\u2019t a big priority at the Alabama School for the Deaf and Blind, and so we usually came out of the season with a single victory.\n\nWhen we arrived, the gym was packed with most every Culver Creek student \u2013 I noticed, for instance, the Creek\u2019s three goth girls reapplying their eyeliner as they sat on the top row of the gym\u2019s bleachers. I\u2019d never attended a school basketball game back home, but I doubted the crowds there were quite so inclusive.\n\nEven so, I was surprised when none other than Kevin Richman sat down on the bleacher directly in front of me while the opposing school\u2019s cheerleading team (their unfortunate school colours were mud-brown and dehydrated-piss-yellow) tried to fire up the small visitors\u2019 section in the crowd. Kevin turned around and stared at the Colonel.\n\nLike most of the other guy Warriors, Kevin dressed preppy, looking like a lawyer-who-enjoys-golfing waiting to happen. And his hair, a blond mop, short on the sides and spiky on top, was always soaked through with so much gel that it looked perennially wet.\n\nI didn\u2019t hate him like the Colonel did, of course, because the Colonel hated him on principle, and principled hate is a hell of a lot stronger than, \u201cBoy, I wish you hadn\u2019t mummified me and thrown me into the lake\u201d hate.\n\nStill, I tried to stare at him intimidatingly as he looked at the Colonel, but it was hard to forget that this guy had seen my skinny ass in nothing but boxers a couple of weeks ago.\n\nYou ratted our Paul and Marya. We got you back. Truce?\u201d Kevin asked.\n\nI didn\u2019t rat them out. Pudge here certainly didn\u2019t rat them out, but you brought him in on your fun. Truce? Hmm, let me take a poll real quick.\u201d The cheerleaders sat down, holding their pom-poms close to their chest as if praying. \u201cHey, Pudge,\u201d the Colonel said. \u201cWhat do you think of a truce?\u201d\n\nIt reminds me of when the Germans demanded that the US surrender at the Battle of the Bulge,\u201d I said. \u201cI guess I\u2019d say to this truce offer what General McAuliffe said to that one: nuts.\u201d\n\nWhy would you try to kill this guy, Kevin? He\u2019s a genius. Nuts to your truce.\u201d\n\nCome on, dude. I know you ratted them out, and we had to defend our friend and now it\u2019s over. Let\u2019s end it.\u201d He seemed very sincere, perhaps due to the Colonel\u2019s reputation for pranking.\n\nI\u2019ll make you a deal. You pick one dead American president. If Pudge doesn\u2019t know that guy\u2019s last words, truce. If he does, you spend the rest of your life lamenting the day you pissed in my shoes.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s retarded.\u201d\n\nAll right, no truce,\u201d the Colonel shot back.\n\nFine. Millard Fillmore,\u201d Kevin said. The Colonel looked at me hurriedly, his eyes saying, Was that guy a president? I just smiled.\n\nWhen Fillmore was dying, he was super hungry. But his doctor was trying to starve his fever or whatever. Fillmore wouldn\u2019t shut up about wanting to eat, though, so finally the doctor gave him a tiny teaspoon of soup.\n\nAnd all sarcastic, Fillmore said, \u2018The nourishment is palatable,\u2019 and then died. No truce.\u201d\n\nKevin rolled his eyes and walked away, and it occurred to me that I could have made up any last words for Millard Fillmore and Kevin probably would have believed me if I\u2019d used that same tone of voice, the Colonel\u2019s confidence rubbing off on me.\n\nThat was your first bad-ass moment!\u201d The Colonel laughed. \u201cNow, it\u2019s true that I gave you an easy target. But still. Well done.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately for the Culver Creek Nothings, we weren\u2019t playing the deaf-and-blind school. We were playing some Christian school from downtown Birmingham, a team stocked with huge, gargantuan apemen with thick beards and a strong distaste for turning the other cheek.\n\nAt the end of the first quarter: 20\u20134.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when the fun started. The Colonel led all of the cheers.\n\nCornbread!\u201d he screamed.\n\nCHICKEN!\u201d the crowd responded.\n\nRice!\u201d\n\nPEAS!\u201d\n\nAnd then, all together: \u201cWE GOT HIGHER S-A-Ts.\u201d\n\nHip Hip Hip Hooray!\u201d the Colonel cried.\n\nYOU\u2019LL BE WORKIN\u2019 FOR US SOME DAY!\u201d\n\nThe opposing team\u2019s cheerleaders tried to answer our cheers with \u201cThe roof, the roof, the roof is on fire! Hell is in your future if you give in to desire,\u201d but we could always do them one better.\n\nBuy!\u201d\n\nSELL!\u201d\n\nTrade!\u201d\n\nBARTER!\u201d\n\nYOU\u2019RE MUCH BIGGER, BUT WE ARE SMARTER!\u201d\n\nWhen the visitors shoot a free throw on most every court in the country, the fans make a lot of noise, screaming and stomping their feet. It doesn\u2019t work, because players learn to tune out white noise.\n\nAt Culver Creek, we had a much better strategy.\n\nAt first, everyone yelled and screamed like in a normal game.\n\nBut then everyone said, \u201cShh!\u201d and there was absolute silence. Just as our hated opponent stopped dribbling and prepared for his shot, the Colonel stood up and screamed something. Like:\n\nFor the love of God, please shave your back hair!\u201d Or:\n\nI need to be saved. Can you minister to me after your shot?!\u201d\n\nTowards the end of the third quarter, the Christian school coach called a time-out and complained to the ref about the Colonel, pointing at him angrily. We were down 56\u201313. The Colonel stood up. \u201cWhat?! You have a problem with me!?\u201d\n\nThe coach screamed, \u201cYou\u2019re bothering my players!\u201d\n\nTHAT\u2019S THE POINT, SHERLOCK!\u201d the Colonel screamed. The ref came over and kicked him out of the gym. I followed him.\n\nI\u2019ve gotten thrown out of thirty-seven straight games,\u201d he said.\n\nDamn.\u201d\n\nYeah. Once or twice, I\u2019ve had to go really crazy. I ran on to the court with eleven seconds left once and stole the ball from the other team. It wasn\u2019t pretty. But, you know. I have a streak to maintain.\u201d\n\nThe Colonel ran ahead of me, gleeful at his ejection, and I jogged after him, trailing in his wake. I wanted to be one of those people who have streaks to maintain, who scorch the ground with their intensity.\n\nBut for now, at least I knew such people, and they needed me, just like comets need tails.\n\nOne Hundred and Eight Days Before\n\nThe next day, Dr Hyde asked me to stay after class. Standing before him, I realised for the first time how hunched his shoulders were, and he seemed suddenly sad and kind of old. \u201cYou like this class, don\u2019t you?\u201d he asked.\n\nYessir.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ve got a lifetime to mull over the Buddhist understanding of interconnectedness.\u201d He spoke every sentence as if he\u2019d written it down, memorised it and was now reciting it.\n\nBut while you were looking out the window, you missed the chance to explore the equally interesting Buddhist belief in being present for every facet of your daily life, of being truly present. Be present in this class.\n\nAnd then, when it\u2019s over, be present out there,\u201d he said, nodding towards the lake and beyond.\n\nYessir.\u201d\n\nOne Hundred and One Days Before\n\nOn the first morning of October, I knew something was wrong as soon as I woke up enough to turn off the alarm clock. The bed didn\u2019t smell right. And I didn\u2019t feel right. It took me a groggy minute before I realised: I felt cold. Well, at the very least, the small fan clipped to my bunk seemed suddenly unnecessary. \u201cIt\u2019s cold!\u201d I shouted.\n\nOh God, what time is it?\u201d I heard above me.\n\nEight-oh-four,\u201d I said.\n\nThe Colonel, who didn\u2019t have an alarm clock but almost always woke up to take a shower before mine went off, swung his short legs over the side of the bed, jumped down and dashed to his dresser.\n\nI suppose I missed my window of opportunity to shower,\u201d he said as he put on a green CULVER CREEK BASKETBALL T-shirt and a pair of shorts.\n\nOh, well. There\u2019s always tomorrow. And it\u2019s not cold. It\u2019s probably eighty.\u201d\n\nGrateful to have slept fully dressed, I just put on shoes and the Colonel and I jogged to the classrooms. I slid into my seat with twenty seconds to spare. Halfway through class, Madame O\u2019Malley turned around to write something in French on the blackboard and Alaska passed me a note.\n\nNice bedhead. Study at McDonald\u2019s for lunch?\n\nOur first significant precalc test was only two days away, so Alaska grabbed the six precalc kids she did not consider Weekday Warriors and piled us into her tiny blue two-door. By happy coincidence, a cute sophomore girl named Lara ended up sitting on my lap.\n\nLara\u2019d been born in Russia or someplace, and she spoke with a slight accent.\n\nSince we were only four layers of clothes from doing it, I took the opportunity to introduce myself.\n\nI know who you are.\u201d She smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re Alaska\u2019s freend from FlowReeda.\u201d\n\nYup. Get ready for a lot of dumb questions, \u2019cause I suck at precalc,\u201d I said.\n\nShe started to answer, but then she was thrown back against me as Alaska shot out of the parking lot.\n\nKids, meet Blue Citrus. So named because she is a lemon,\u201d Alaska said.\n\nBlue Citrus, meet the kids. If you can find them, you might want to fasten your seat belts. Pudge, you might want to serve as a seat belt for Lara.\u201d What the car lacked in speed, Alaska made up for by refusing to move her foot from the accelerator, damn the consequences.\n\nBefore we even got off campus, Lara was lurching helplessly whenever Alaska took hard turns, so I took Alaska\u2019s advice and wrapped my arms around Lara\u2019s waist.\n\nThanks,\u201d she said, almost inaudibly.\n\nAfter a fast if reckless three miles to McDonald\u2019s, we ordered seven large French fries to share. Alaska taught class, smoking while she ate.\n\nLike any good teacher, she tolerated little dissension. She smoked and talked and ate for an hour without stopping, and I scribbled in my notebook as the muddy waters of tangents and cosines began to clarify. But not everyone was so fortunate.\n\nAs Alaska zipped through something obvious about linear equations, stoner/baller Hank Walsten said, \u201cWait wait. I don\u2019t get it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because you have eight functioning brain cells.\u201d\n\n\u201cStudies show that marijuana is better for your health than those cigarettes,\u201d Hank said.\n\nAlaska swallowed a mouthful of French fries took a drag on her cigarette and blew smoke across the table at Hank. \u201cI may die young,\u201d she said, \u201cbut at least I\u2019ll die smart. Now, back to tangents.\u201d\n\nOne Hundred Days Before\n\nNot to ask the obvious question, but why Alaska?\u201d I asked. I\u2019d just gotten my precalc test back and I was awash with admiration for Alaska, since her tutoring had paved my way to a B-plus. She and I sat alone in the TV lounge watching MTV on a drearily cloudy Saturday.\n\nFurnished with couches left behind by previous generations of Culver Creek students, the TV room had the musty air of dust and mildew \u2013 and, perhaps for that reason, was almost perennially unoccupied. Alaska took a sip of Mountain Dew and grabbed my hand in hers.\n\nAlways comes up eventually. All right, so my mom was something of a hippie when I was a kid. You know, wore oversized sweaters she knitted herself, smoked a lot of pot, etc.\n\nAnd my dad was a real Republican type, and so when I was born, my mom wanted to name me Harmony Springs Young and my dad wanted to name me Mary Frances Young.\u201d\n\nAs she talked, she bobbed her head back and forth to the MTV music, even though the song was the kind of manufactured pop ballad she professed to hate.\n\nSo instead of naming me Harmony or Mary, they agreed to let me decide. So when I was little, they called me Mary. I mean, they called me sweetie or whatever, but like on school forms and stuff, they wrote Mary Young.\n\nAnd then on my seventh birthday, my present was that I got to pick my name. Cool, huh? So I spent the whole day looking at my dad\u2019s globe for a really cool name. And so my first choice was Chad, like the country in Africa. But then my dad said that was a boy\u2019s name, so I picked Alaska.\u201d\n\nI wish my parents had let me pick my name. But they went ahead and picked the only name first-born male Halters have had for a century. \u201cBut why Alaska?\u201d I asked her.\n\nShe smiled with the right side of her mouth. \u201cWell, later, I found out what it means. It\u2019s from an Aleut word, Alyeska. It means, \u2018That which the sea breaks against\u2019 and I love that.\n\nBut at the time, I just saw Alaska up there. And it was big, just like I wanted to be. And it was damn far away from Vine Station, Alabama, just like I wanted to be.\u201d\n\nI laughed. \u201cAnd now you\u2019re all grown up and fairly far away from home,\u201d I said, smiling. \u201cSo congratulations.\u201d She stopped the head bobbing and let go of my (unfortunately sweaty) hand.\n\nGetting out isn\u2019t that easy,\u201d she said seriously, her eyes on mine like I knew the way out and wouldn\u2019t tell her. And then she seemed to switch conversational horses in midstream.\n\nLike after college, know what I want to do? Teach disabled kids. I\u2019m a good teacher, right? Shit, if I can teach you precalc, I can teach it to anybody. Like maybe kids with autism.\u201d\n\nShe talked softly and thoughtfully, like she was telling me a secret, and I leaned in towards her, suddenly overwhelmed with the feeling that we must kiss, that we ought to kiss right now on the dusty orange couch with its cigarette burns and its decades of collected dust.\n\nAnd I would have: I would have kept leaning towards her until it became necessary to tilt my face so as to miss her ski-slope nose, and I would have felt the shock of her so-soft lips. I would have. But then she snapped out of it.\n\nNo,\u201d she said, and I couldn\u2019t tell at first whether she was reading my kiss-obsessed mind or responding to herself out loud. She turned away from me, and softly, maybe to herself, said, \u201cJesus, I\u2019m not going to be one of those people who sits around talking about what they\u2019re gonna do. I\u2019m just going to do it. Imagining the future is a kind of nostalgia.\u201d\n\nHuh?\u201d I asked.\n\nYou spend your whole life stuck in the labyrinth, thinking about how you\u2019ll escape it one day, and how awesome it will be, and imagining that future keeps you going, but you never do it. You just use the future to escape the present.\u201d\n\nI guess that made sense. I had imagined that life at the Creek would be a bit more exciting than it was \u2013 in reality, there\u2019d been more homework than adventure \u2013 but if I hadn\u2019t imagined it, I would never have gotten to the Creek at all.\n\nShe turned back to the TV, a commercial for a car now, and made a joke about Blue Citrus needing its own car commercial. Mimicking the deep-voiced passion of commercial voice-overs, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s small, it\u2019s slow and it\u2019s shitty, but it runs. Sometimes.\n\nBlue Citrus: See Your Local Used Car Dealer.\u201d But I wanted to talk more about her and Vine Station and the future.\n\nSometimes I don\u2019t get you,\u201d I said.\n\nShe didn\u2019t even glance at me. She just smiled towards the television and said, \u201cYou never get me. That\u2019s the whole point.\u201d\n\nNinety-nine Days Before\n\nI spent most of the next day lying in bed, immersed in the miserably uninteresting fictional world of Ethan Frome while the Colonel sat at his desk, unravelling the secrets of differential equations or something.\n\nAlthough we tried to ration our smoke breaks amid the shower\u2019s steam, we ran out of cigarettes before dark, necessitating a trip to Alaska\u2019s room. She lay on the floor, holding a book over her head.\n\nLet\u2019s go smoke,\u201d he said.\n\nYou\u2019re out of cigarettes, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she asked without looking up.\n\nWell. Yes.\u201d\n\nGot five bucks?\u201d she asked.\n\nNope.\u201d\n\nPudge?\u201d she asked.\n\nYeah, all right.\u201d I fished a five out of my pocket and Alaska handed me a pack of twenty Marlboro Lights. I knew I\u2019d smoke maybe five of them, but so long as I subsidised the Colonel\u2019s smoking, he couldn\u2019t really attack me for being another rich kid, a Weekday Warrior who just didn\u2019t happen to live in Birmingham.\n\nWe grabbed Takumi and walked down to the lake, hiding behind a few trees, laughing. The Colonel blew smoke rings and Takumi called them \u201cpretentious\u201d, while Alaska followed the smoke rings with her fingers, stabbing at them like a kid trying to pop bubbles.\n\nAnd then we heard a branch break. It might have been a deer, but the Colonel busted out anyway. A voice directly behind us said, \u201cDon\u2019t run, Chipper,\u201d and the Colonel stopped, turned around and returned to us sheepishly.\n\nThe Eagle walked towards us slowly, his lips pursed in disgust. He wore a white shirt and a black tie, like always. He gave each of us in turn the Look of Doom.\n\nY\u2019all smell like a North Carolina tobacco field in a wildfire,\u201d he said.\n\nWe stood silent. I felt disproportionately terrible, like I had just been caught fleeing the scene of a murder. Would he call my parents?\n\nI\u2019ll see you in Jury tomorrow at five,\u201d he announced and then walked away. Alaska crouched down, picked up the cigarette she had thrown away and started smoking again. The Eagle wheeled around, his sixth sense detecting Insubordination To Authority Figures. Alaska dropped the cigarette and stepped on it. The Eagle shook his head, and even though he must have been crazy mad, I swear to God he smiled.\n\nHe loves me,\u201d Alaska told me as we walked back to the dorm circle. \u201cHe loves all y\u2019all too. He just loves the school more. That\u2019s the thing. He thinks busting us is good for the school and good for us. It\u2019s the eternal struggle, Pudge. The Good versus the Naughty.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re awfully philosophical for a girl that just got busted,\u201d I told her.\n\nSometimes you lose a battle. But mischief always wins the war.\u201d\n\nNinety-eight Days Before\n\nOne of the unique things about Culver Creek was the Jury. Every semester, the faculty elected twelve students, three from each class, to serve on the Jury. The Jury meted out punishment for non-expellable offences, for everything from staying out past curfew to smoking.\n\nUsually, it was smoking or being in a girl\u2019s room after seven. So you went to the Jury, you made your case and they punished you. The Eagle served as the Judge, and he had the right to overturn the Jury\u2019s verdict (just like in the real American court system), but he almost never did.\n\nI made my way to Classroom 4 right after my last class \u2013 forty minutes early, just to be safe. I sat with my back against the wall and read my American History textbook (kind of remedial reading for me, to be honest) until Alaska showed up and sat down next to me. She was chewing on her bottom lip and I asked whether she was nervous.\n\nWell, yeah. Listen, just sit tight and don\u2019t talk,\u201d she told me. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be nervous. But this is the seventh time I\u2019ve been caught smoking. I just don\u2019t want \u2013 whatever. I don\u2019t want to upset my dad.\u201d\n\nDoes your mom smoke or something?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNot any more,\u201d Alaska said. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. You\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t start to worry until it got to be 4.50 and the Colonel and Takumi were still unaccounted for. The members of the Jury filed in one by one, walking past us without any eye contact, which made me feel worse. I counted all twelve by 4.56, plus the Eagle.\n\nAt 4.58, the Colonel and Takumi rounded the corner towards the classrooms.\n\nI never saw anything like it. Takumi wore a starched white shirt and a red tie with a black paisley print; the Colonel wore his wrinkled pink button-down and flamingo tie. They walked in step, heads up and shoulders back like some kind of action movie heroes.\n\nI heard Alaska sigh. \u201cThe Colonel\u2019s doing his Napoleon walk.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s all good,\u201d the Colonel told me. \u201cJust don\u2019t say anything.\u201d\n\nWe walked in \u2013 two of us wearing ties and two of us wearing ratty T-shirts \u2013 and the Eagle banged an honest-to-God gavel against the podium in front of him. The Jury sat in a line behind a rectangular table. At the front of the room, by the blackboard, were four chairs. We sat down and the Colonel explained exactly what happened.\n\nAlaska and I were smoking down by the lake. We usually go off campus, but we forgot. We\u2019re sorry. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t know what was going on. But I knew my job: sit tight and shut up. One of the kids looked at Takumi and asked, \u201cWhat about you and Halter?\u201d\n\nWe were keeping them company,\u201d Takumi said calmly.\n\nThe kid turned to the Eagle then and asked, \u201cDid you see anyone smoking?\u201d\n\nI only saw Alaska, but Chip ran away, which struck me as cowardly, as does Miles and Takumi\u2019s \u2018aw-shucks\u2019 routine,\u201d the Eagle said, giving me the Look of Doom. I didn\u2019t want to look guilty, but I couldn\u2019t hold his stare, so I just looked down at my hands.\n\nThe Colonel gritted his teeth, like it pained him to lie. \u201cIt is the truth, sir.\u201d\n\nThe Eagle asked if any of us wanted to say anything, and then asked if there were any more questions, and then sent us outside.\n\nWhat the hell was that?\u201d I asked Takumi when we got outside.\n\nJust sit tight, Pudge.\u201d\n\nWhy have Alaska confess when she\u2019d already been in trouble so many times? Why the Colonel, who literally couldn\u2019t afford to get in serious trouble? Why not me? I\u2019d never been busted for anything. I had the least to lose. After a couple of minutes, the Eagle came out and motioned for us to come back inside.\n\nAlaska and Chip,\u201d a member of the Jury said, \u201cyou get ten work hours \u2013 doing dishes in the cafeteria \u2013 and you\u2019re both officially one problem away from a phone call home. Takumi and Miles, there\u2019s nothing in the rules about watching someone smoke, but the Jury will remember your story if you break the rules again. Fair?\u201d\n\nFair,\u201d Alaska said quickly, obviously relieved. On my way out, the Eagle spun me around.\n\nDon\u2019t abuse your privileges at this school, young man, or you will regret it.\u201d I nodded.\n\nEighty-nine Days Before\n\nWe found you a girlfriend,\u201d Alaska said to me. Still, no one had explained to me what happened the week before with the Jury. It didn\u2019t seem to have affected Alaska, though, who was (1) in our room after dark with the door closed, and (2) smoking a cigarette as she sat on the mostly foam couch. She had stuffed a towel into the bottom of our door and insisted it was safe, but I worried \u2013 about the cigarette and the \u201cgirlfriend\u201d.\n\nAll I have to do now,\u201d she said, \u201cis convince you to like her and convince her to like you.\u201d\n\nMonumental tasks,\u201d the Colonel pointed out. He lay on the top bunk, reading for his English class. Moby Dick.\n\nHow can you read and talk at the same time?\u201d I asked.\n\nWell, I usually can\u2019t, but neither the book nor the conversation is particularly intellectually challenging.\u201d\n\nI like that book,\u201d Alaska said.\n\nYes.\u201d The Colonel smiled and leaned over to look at her from his top bunk. \u201cYou would. Big white whale is a metaphor for everything. You live for pretentious metaphors.\u201d\n\nAlaska was unfazed. \u201cSo, Pudge, what\u2019s your feeling on the former Soviet bloc?\u201d\n\nUm. I\u2019m in favour of it?\u201d\n\nShe flicked the ashes of her cigarette into my pencil holder. I almost protested, but why bother.\n\nYou know that girl in our precalc class,\u201d Alaska said. \u201cSoft voice, says thees not this. Know that girl?\u201d\n\nYeah. Lara. She sat on my lap on the way to McDonald\u2019s.\u201d\n\nRight. I know. And she liked you. You thought she was quietly discussing precalc, when she was clearly talking about having hot sex with you. Which is why you need me.\u201d\n\nShe has great breasts,\u201d the Colonel said without looking up from the whale.\n\nDO NOT OBJECTIFY WOMEN\u2019S BODIES!\u201d Alaska shouted.\n\nNow he looked up. \u201cSorry. Perky breasts.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not any better!\u201d\n\nSure it is,\u201d he said. \u201cGreat is a judgement on a woman\u2019s body. Perky is merely an observation. They are perky. I mean, Christ.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re hopeless,\u201d she said. \u201cSo she thinks you\u2019re cute, Pudge.\u201d\n\nNice.\u201d\n\nDoesn\u2019t mean anything. Problem with you is that if you talk to her you\u2019ll \u2018uh um uh\u2019 your way to disaster.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t be so hard on him,\u201d the Colonel interrupted, as if he\u2019s my mom. \u201cGod, I understand whale anatomy. Can we move on now, Herman?\u201d\n\nSo Jake is going to be in Birmingham this weekend and we\u2019re going on a triple date. Well, triple and a half, since Takumi will be there too. Very low pressure. You won\u2019t be able to screw up because I\u2019ll be there the whole time.\u201d\n\nOK.\u201d\n\nWho\u2019s my date?\u201d the Colonel asked.\n\nYour girlfriend is your date.\u201d\n\nAll right,\u201d he said, and then deadpanned, \u201cbut we don\u2019t get along very well.\u201d\n\nSo Friday? Do you have plans for Friday?\u201d and then I laughed because the Colonel and I didn\u2019t have plans for this Friday, or for any other Friday for the rest of our lives.\n\nI didn\u2019t think so.\u201d She smiled. \u201cNow, we gotta go do dishes in the cafeteria, Chipper. God, the sacrifices I make.\u201d\n\nEighty-seven Days Before\n\nOur triple-and-a-half date started off well enough. I was in Alaska\u2019s room \u2013 for the sake of getting me a girlfriend, she\u2019d agreed to iron a green button-down shirt for me \u2013 when Jake showed up. With blond hair to his shoulders, dark stubble on his cheeks and the kind of faux-ruggedness that gets you a career as a catalogue model, Jake was every bit as good-looking as you\u2019d expect Alaska\u2019s boyfriend to be.\n\nShe jumped on to him and wrapped her legs around him (God forbid anyone ever does that to me, I thought. I\u2019ll fall over). I\u2019d heard Alaska talk about kissing, but I\u2019d never seen her kiss until then: as he held her by her waist, she leaned forward, her pouty lips parted, her head just slightly tilted, and enveloped his mouth with such passion that I felt I should look away but couldn\u2019t. A good while later, she untangled herself from Jake and introduced me.\n\nThis is Pudge,\u201d she said. Jake and I shook hands.\n\nI\u2019ve heard a lot about ya,\u201d he spoke with a slight Southern accent, one of the few I\u2019d heard outside of McDonald\u2019s. \u201cI hope your date works out tonight, \u2019cause I wouldn\u2019t want you stealin\u2019 Alaska out from under me.\u201d\n\nGod, you\u2019re so adorable,\u201d Alaska said before I could answer, kissing him again. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she laughed. \u201cI just can\u2019t seem to stop kissing my boyfriend.\u201d\n\nI put on my freshly starched green shirt and the three of us gathered up the Colonel, Sara, Lara and Takumi, and then walked to the gym to watch the Culver Creek Nothings take on Harsden Academy, a private day school in Mountain Brook, Birmingham\u2019s richest suburb.\n\nThe Colonel\u2019s hatred for Harsden burned with the fire of a thousand suns. \u201cThe only thing I hate more than rich people,\u201d he told me as we walked to the gym, \u201cis stupid people. And all the kids at Harsden are rich, and they\u2019re all too stupid to get into the Creek.\u201d\n\nSince we were supposed to be on a date and all, I thought I\u2019d sit next to Lara at the game, but as I tried to walk past a seated Alaska on my way to Lara, Alaska shot me a look and patted the empty spot next to her on the bleachers.\n\nI\u2019m not allowed to sit next to my date?\u201d I asked.\n\nPudge, one of us has been a girl her whole life. The other of us has never gotten to second base. If I were you, I\u2019d sit down, look cute and be your pleasantly aloof self.\u201d\n\nOK. Whatever you say.\u201d\n\nJake said, \u201cThat\u2019s pretty much my strategy for pleasing Alaska.\u201d\n\nAww,\u201d she said, \u201cso sweet! Pudge, did I tell you that Jake is recording an album with his band? They\u2019re fantastic. They\u2019re like Radiohead meets the Flaming Lips.\n\nDid I tell you that I came up with their name, Hickman Territory?\u201d And then, realising she was being silly: \u201cDid I tell you that Jake is hung like a horse and a beautiful, sensual lover?\u201d\n\nBaby, Jesus.\u201d Jake smiled. \u201cNot in front of the kids.\u201d\n\nI wanted to hate Jake, of course, but as I watched them together, smiling and fumbling all over one another, I didn\u2019t hate him. I wanted to be him, sure, but I tried to remember I was ostensibly on a date with someone else.\n\nHarsden Academy\u2019s star player was a six-foot-seven Goliath named Travis Eastman that everyone \u2013 even his mother I suspect \u2013 called the Beast. The first time the Beast got to the free-throw line, the Colonel could not keep himself from swearing while he taunted:\n\nYou owe everything to your daddy, you stupid redneck bastard.\u201d\n\nThe Beast turned around and glared, and the Colonel almost got kicked out after the first free throw, but he smiled at the ref and said, \u201cSorry!\u201d\n\nI want to stay around for a good part of this one,\u201d he said to me.\n\nAt the start of the second half, with the Creek down by a surprisingly slim margin of twenty-four points and the Beast at the foul line, the Colonel looked at Takumi and said, \u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201d Takumi and the Colonel stood up as the crowd went, \u201cShhh \u2026\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know if this is the best time to tell you this,\u201d the Colonel shouted at the Beast, \u201cbut Takumi here hooked up with your girlfriend just before the game.\u201d\n\nThat made everyone laugh \u2013 except the Beast, who turned from the free throw line and walked calmly, with the ball, towards us.\n\nI think we run now,\u201d Takumi said.\n\nI haven\u2019t gotten kicked out,\u201d the Colonel answered.\n\nLater,\u201d Takumi said.\n\nI don\u2019t know whether it was the general anxiety of being on a date (albeit one with my would-be date sitting five people away from me) or the specific anxiety of having the Beast stare in my direction, but for some reason,\n\nI took off running after Takumi. I thought we were in the clear as we began to round the corner of the bleachers, but then I saw, out of the corner of my eye, a cylindrical orange object getting bigger and bigger, like a fast-approaching sun.\n\nI thought: I think that is going to hit me.\n\nI thought: I should duck\n\nBut in the time between when something gets thought and when it gets done, the ball hit me square across the side of the face. I fell, the back of my head slamming against the gym floor. I then stood up immediately, as if unhurt \u2026 and left the gym.\n\nPride had gotten me off the floor of the gym, but as soon as I was outside, I sat down.\n\nI am concussed,\u201d I announced, entirely sure of my self-diagnosis.\n\nYou\u2019re fine,\u201d Takumi said as he jogged back towards me. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here before we\u2019re killed.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t get up. I have suffered a mild concussion.\u201d\n\nLara ran out and sat down next to me.\n\nAre you OK?\u201d\n\nI am concussed,\u201d I said.\n\nTakumi sat down with me and looked me in the eye. \u201cDo you know what happened to you?\u201d\n\nThe Beast got me.\u201d\n\nDo you know where you are?\u201d\n\nI\u2019m on a triple-and-a-half date.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re fine,\u201d Takumi said. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nAnd then I leaned forward and threw up on to Lara\u2019s pants. I can\u2019t say why I didn\u2019t lean backwards or to the side. I leaned forward and aimed my mouth towards her jeans \u2013 a nice, butt-flattering pair of jeans, the kind of pants a girl wears when she wants to look nice but not look like she is trying to look nice \u2013 and I threw up all over them.\n\nMostly peanut butter, but also clearly some corn.\n\nOh!\u201d she said, surprised and slightly horrified.\n\nOh God,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\n\nI think you might have a concussion,\u201d Takumi said, as if the idea had never been suggested.\n\nI am suffering from the nausea and dizziness typically associated with a mild concussion,\u201d I recited. While Takumi went to get the Eagle and Lara changed pants, I lay on the concrete sidewalk.\n\nThe Eagle came back with the school nurse, who diagnosed me with \u2013 get this \u2013 a concussion, and then Takumi drove me to the hospital with Lara riding shotgun.\n\nApparently, I lay in the back and slowly repeated the words: \u201cThe. Symptoms Generally. Associated. With. Concussion.\u201d\n\nSo I spent my date at the hospital with Lara and Takumi. The doctor told me to go home and sleep a lot, but to make sure and have someone wake me up every four hours or so.\n\nI vaguely remember Lara standing in the doorway, the room dark and the outside dark and everything mild and comfortable but sort of spinny, the world pulsing as if from a heavy bass beat. And I vaguely remember Lara smiling at me from the doorway, the glittering ambiguity of a girl\u2019s smile, which seems to promise an answer to the question but never gives it.\n\nThe question, the one we\u2019ve all been asking since girls stopped being gross, the question that is too simple to be uncomplicated: does she like me or like me? And then I fell deeply, endlessly asleep and slept until three in the morning, when the Colonel woke me up.\n\nShe dumped me,\u201d he said.\n\nI am concussed,\u201d I responded.\n\nSo I heard. Hence my waking you up. Video game?\u201d\n\nOK. But keep it on mute. My head hurts.\u201d\n\nYeah. Heard you puked on Lara. Very suave.\u201d\n\nDumped?\u201d I asked, getting up.\n\nYeah. Sara told Jake that I had a hard-on for Alaska. Those words. In that order. And I was like, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t have a hard on for anything at this moment. You can check if you\u2019d like,\u2019 and Sara thought I was being too glib, I suppose, because then she said she knew for a fact I\u2019d hooked up with Alaska.\n\nWhich, incidentally, is ridiculous. I. Don\u2019t. Cheat,\u201d he said, and finally the game finished loading and I half listened as I drove a stock car in circles around a silent track in Talladega. The circles nauseated me, but I kept at it.\n\nSo Alaska went ballistic, basically.\u201d He affected Alaska\u2019s voice then, making it more shrill and headache-inducing than it actually was.\n\n\u2018No woman should ever lie about another woman! You\u2019ve violated the sacred covenant between women! How will stabbing one another in the back help women to rise above patriarchal oppression?!\u2019 And so on.\n\nAnd then Jake came to Alaska\u2019s defence, saying that she would never cheat because she loved him, and then I was like, \u2018Don\u2019t worry about Sara. She just likes bullying people.\u2019 And then Sara asked me why I never stood up for her, and somewhere in there I called her a crazy bitch, which didn\u2019t go over particularly well.\n\nAnd then the waitress asked us to leave, and so we were standing in the parking lot and she said, \u2018I\u2019ve had enough,\u2019 and I just stared at her and she said, \u2018Our relationship is over.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe stopped talking then. \u201cOur relationship is over?\u201d I repeated. I felt very spacey, and thought it was just best to repeat the last phrase of whatever the Colonel said, so he could keep talking.\n\nYeah. So that\u2019s it. You know what\u2019s lame, Pudge? I really care about her. I mean, we were hopeless. Badly matched. But still. I mean, I said I loved her. I lost my virginity to her.\u201d\n\nYou lost your virginity to her?\u201d\n\nYeah. Yeah. I never told you that? She\u2019s the only girl I\u2019ve slept with. I don\u2019t know. Even though we fought, like, 94 per cent of the time, I\u2019m really sad.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re really sad?\u201d\n\nSadder than I thought I\u2019d be, anyway. I mean, I knew it was inevitable. We haven\u2019t had a pleasant moment this whole year. Ever since I got here, I mean, we were just on each other relentlessly. I should have been nicer to her. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s sad.\u201d\n\nIt is sad,\u201d I repeated.\n\nI mean, it\u2019s stupid to miss someone you didn\u2019t even get along with. But, I don\u2019t know, it was nice, you know, having someone you could always fight with.\u201d\n\nFighting,\u201d I said, and then, confused, barely able to drive, I added, \u201cis nice.\u201d\n\nRight. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do now. I mean, it was nice to have her. I\u2019m a mad guy, Pudge. What do I do with that?\u201d\n\nYou can fight with me,\u201d I said. I put my controller down and leaned back on our foam couch and was asleep.\n\nAs I drifted off, I heard the Colonel say, \u201cI can\u2019t be mad at you, you harmless skinny bastard.\u201d\n\nEighty-four Days Before\n\nThree days later, the rain began. My head still hurt, and the sizeable knot above my left temple looked, the Colonel thought, like a miniaturised topographical map of Macedonia, which I had not previously known was a place, let alone a country.\n\nAnd as the Colonel and I walked over the parched, half-dead grass that Monday, I said, \u201cI suppose we could use some rain,\u201d and the Colonel looked up at the low clouds coming in fast and threatening, and then he said, \u201cWell, use it or not, we\u2019re sure as shit going to get some.\u201d\n\nAnd we sure as shit did. Twenty minutes into French class and Madame O\u2019Malley was conjugating the verb \u201cto believe\u201d in the subjunctive.\n\nJe croie. Tu croies. Il ou elle croie. She said it over and over, like it wasn\u2019t a verb so much as a Buddhist mantra.\n\nQue je croie; Que tu croies; Qu\u2019il ou qu\u2019elle croie. What a funny thing to say over and over again: I would believe; you would believe; he or she would believe. Believe what? I thought, and right then, the rain came.\n\nIt came all at once and in a furious torrent, like God was mad and wanted to flood us out.\n\nDay after day, night after night, it rained. It rained so that I couldn\u2019t see across the dorm circle, so that the lake swelled up and lapped against the Adirondack swing, swallowing half of the fake beach.\n\nBy the third day, I abandoned my umbrella entirely and walked around in a perpetual state of wetness. Everything at the cafeteria tasted like the minor acid of rainwater and everything stank of mildew, and showers became ludicrously inappropriate because the whole goddamned world had better water pressure than the showers.\n\nAnd the rain made hermits of us all. The Colonel spent every not-in-class moment sitting on the couch, reading the almanac and playing video games, and I wasn\u2019t sure whether he wanted to talk or whether he just wanted to sit on the white foam and drink his ambrosia in peace.\n\nAfter the disaster that was our \u201cdate\u201d I felt it best not to speak to Lara under any circumstances, lest I suffer a concussion and/or an attack of puking, even though she\u2019d told me in precalc the next day that it was \u201cno beeg deal\u201d.\n\nAnd I saw Alaska only in class and could never talk to her, because she came to every class late and left the moment the bell rang, before I could even cap my pen and close my notebook.\n\nOn the fifth evening of the rain, I walked into the cafeteria fully prepared to go back to my room and eat a reheated bufriedo for dinner if Alaska and/or Takumi weren\u2019t eating (I knew full well the Colonel was in Room 43, dining on milk \u2018n\u2019 vodka). But I stayed because I saw Alaska sitting alone, her back to the rain-streaked window. I grabbed a heaped plate of fried okra and sat down next to her.\n\nGod, it\u2019s like it\u2019ll never end,\u201d I said, referring to the rain.\n\nIndeed,\u201d she said. Her wet hair hung from her head and mostly covered her face. I ate some. She ate some.\n\nHow\u2019ve you been?\u201d I finally asked.\n\nI\u2019m really not up for answering any questions that start with how, when, where, why or what.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked.\n\nThat\u2019s a what. I\u2019m not doing whats right now. All right, I should go.\u201d She pursed her lips and exhaled slowly, like the way the Colonel blew out smoke.\n\nWhat\u2014\u201d and then I stopped myself and reworded. \u201cDid I do something?\u201d I asked.\n\nShe gathered her tray and stood up before answering. \u201cOf course not, sweetie.\u201d\n\nHer sweetie felt condescending, not romantic, like a boy enduring his first biblical rainstorm couldn\u2019t possibly understand her problems \u2013 whatever they were. It took a sincere effort not to roll my eyes at her, though she wouldn\u2019t have even noticed as she walked out of the cafeteria with her hair dripping over her face.7Embed"}
