{"Lyrics": "1 ContributorLotus LyricsNo one untouched by it, in filth we thrive\nDarkness sublimated, from this we all derive\nAlluvium rising higher, hiding the way to my desire\nMysteriously \u2013\nFalling away or flying free\u2026\n\nEach one of us keeps fighting not to be broken down, until we realize\nFor one instant my love and my anguish fertilize\nLevity mysteriously Washes over me\nClimbing up out of the water\nAm I flying high, or falling away like a moment of clarity\nLotus transcending out of the mire \u2013\nPure\u2026\n\nAnd when I open my eyes all that's there to see\nRelies on every step I took while blind\nImpossible desire to embrace the child\nThat fills the void you left behind\nAlluvium keeps rising higher\nFor one instant my essence is one with the sky\nLevity mysteriously\nWashes over me\nClimbing up out of the water\nAm I flying high, or falling away like a moment of clarity\nMysteriously dancing too slow to see\nCool fire washing over me\nYou might also likeAnd now I'm flying high\u2026\nLong enough just to say\nLong enough just to play through this melody of senses\nAnd the shadow inside this hollow disguise\n\n(Water, Earth, Air, Fire combine, fertilize your shadow with light)\nWill radiate when all elements arise\nAs one\u2026Embed"}
