Baby, Can you wait for me?\"\nI said, \"Baby, can you wait for me?\"\nShe said, \"Take ya time, I'll be waiting patiently.\"\n[Hook]\nAin't no question if I want it, I need it\nI can feel it slowly drifting away from me\nI'm gone need it so while you playing, I'm saying\nI will never ever let you live this down, down, downEmbed"}
