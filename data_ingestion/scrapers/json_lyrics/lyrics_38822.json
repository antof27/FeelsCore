{"Lyrics": "3 ContributorsGhost Lyrics[Verse 1: Michael Bohn]\nLook in my direction as I walk right out on you\nDemanded perfection, what was I supposed to do?\nAnd I never lied to you, brought out the worst in me\nAnd you were never one for dealing with reality\nWith all you put me through, still never lied to you\n\n[Chorus: Hance Alligood]\nBut I've learned to love letting go\nI'm face to face with your ghost in the mirror\nI think I'm getting too close\nYou'll never kill the sound\nDon't try to drown me out\n(Don't try to drown me out)\n(Don't try to drown me out)\n\n[Verse 2: Michael Bohn]\nHear your voice in my head, every thought that I see\nI could never fit the mold of who you thought I should be\nWith all that we've been through, still never lied to you\n\n[Chorus: Hance Alligood]\nBut I've learned to love letting go\nI'm face to face with your ghost in the mirror\nI think I'm getting too close\nYou'll never kill the sound\nDon't try to drown me out\nYou might also like[Breakdown: Michael Bohn]\nTake everything you said, play it back inside your head\nKeep all your fake regret, save it 'cause I'm sick to death\nGet up, get up and see you're losing everything\nFuck your apathy, I'll keep my mental clarity\n\n[Chorus: Hance Alligood]\nOh, I'm face to face with your ghost in the mirror\nI think I'm getting too close\nYou'll never kill the sound\nI've learned to love letting go\nI'm face to face with your ghost in the mirror\nI think I'm getting too close\nYou'll never kill the sound (You'll never kill the sound)\nDon't try to drown me out\n\n[Outro: Michael Bohn]\nLook in my direction\nAs I walk right out on youEmbed"}
