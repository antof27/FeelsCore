{"Lyrics": "2 ContributorsForgotten Kings Lyrics[Intro]\nThe chained up body is rotting in a prison\nFrostbite, skin turning black as it falls from the limbs\nAncient gods sentenced for eternity\nCrooked judge, a thousand years spent in isolation\nAbandoned and trapped\nHidden from the sight of the world\nSharpened stones are grinding into the skin\n\n[Verse 1]\nThe iron mask is pushing rusty spikes into the face\nBlackened vultures circling, purple blood runs down the chin\nCrush me, burn me, deliver me from pain\nA crown of thorns decorating the skull\nThe purple blood runs down th\u0435 chin\nThin air poisoning my curse ridden helpl\u0435ss mind\nEternal circle, every day is living hell in this world\nFalse idols perishing to the masses\nFilled up with haughtiness and pride\nDegenerate and viciousness\nThe cries of pain howled through the hall\nThey get drunken with power, again and again\n\n[Chorus]\nServe your sentence, shackled to a mountain summit\nAs the sky will break open\nKneel before the graveside of forgotten kings\nShiver to the power of forgotten kings\nOf forgotten kings\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nWine tastes like salty water\nBread tastes like rotten flesh\nAs the sun and the moon rise and set\nEagles nourish from my guts\nPecking their beaks in my flesh\nA river of blood streaming down the glaciers\nHands go numb and fingers lost\n\n[Bridge]\nNever ending torment\nRunes are carved into the crumbling stone below my feet\nRead the words, bite my tongue, spitting blood upon the snow\nBow my head, icy hail\nPlease lord take my hand and save my soul\n\n[Breakdown]\nRot in hell\nAs they announce the final judgement\nVerdict was spoken by the gods\nHammer has fallen\nEmbrace armageddon\nMy hollowed soul died in the face of the holy mother\n\n[Chorus]\nServe your sentence, shackled to a mountain summit\nAs the sky will break open\nKneel before the graveside of forgotten kings\nShiver to the power of forgotten kings\nOf forgotten kingsEmbed"}
