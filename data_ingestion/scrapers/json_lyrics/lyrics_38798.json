(Oh-oh, oh-oh)\nAnd in the black hole (Ayy, ayy, ayy-ayy, oh-oh)\nYou will see it all (Oh-oh, oh-oh)\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause this is not enough\nAnd I won't wait for them to cut me up\nSo give me all you got\nThey'll never stop until they see it fall\nSo let's run (Ayy, ayy, ayy-ayy, oh-oh)\n(Oh-oh, oh-oh)\nSo let's run (Run) (Ayy, ayy, ayy-ayy, oh-oh)\n(Oh-oh, oh-oh)\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nYour head's a hurricane, it moves in waves (Ayy, ayy, ayy-ayy, oh-oh)\nA perfect storm that keeps you wide awake (Oh-oh, oh-oh)\nBut through the silence (Ayy, ayy, ayy-ayy, oh-oh)\nYou will feel it burn (Oh-oh, oh-oh)\nSo take my hand and let's fade away (Ayy, ayy, ayy-ayy, oh-oh)\nYou know there's nothing here to make us stay (Oh-oh, oh-oh)\nAnd in the darkness (Ayy, ayy, ayy-ayy, oh-oh)\nYou will see the sun\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause this is not enough\nAnd I won't wait for them to cut me up\nSo give me all you got\nThey'll never stop until they see it fall\n\n[Bridge]\nSo let's run away, 'cause everything's broken\nAnd we're so much more than another brick in the grey\nSo give it your every, give me your everything\nAnd let's get away, 'cause everything's broken\nI know that we're more than another brick in the grey\nSo give it your every, give me your everything\n(It's not enough, it's not enough)\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause this is not enough\nAnd I won't wait for them to cut me up\nSo give me all you got\nThey'll never stop until they see it fall\nSo let's run\n[Instrumental Bridge]\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause this is not enough\nAnd I won't wait for them to cut me up\nSo give me all you got\nThey'll never stop until they see it fall\nSo let's run (Ayy, ayy, ayy-ayy, oh-oh)\n(Oh-oh, oh-oh)\nSo let's run (Ayy, ayy, ayy-ayy, oh-oh)\n(Oh-oh, oh-oh)\nSo let's run11Embed"}
