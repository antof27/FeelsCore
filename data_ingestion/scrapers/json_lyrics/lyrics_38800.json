{"Lyrics": "3 ContributorsFertile Steps LyricsMy life is proof purgatory is real\nPain is my brother\nTemptation my sister\nMarried to Misery against my will\nI tear open my chest\nLet water collect\nRoots grow\nCrack bones\nFertile steps is my best bet to turn it all around\n\nRelapse\nCollapse\nRelinquish\nRebuild\n\nA slip of the tongue and it falls right out\nDrags along the concrete\nRed carpet to Hell on Earth\nAs the streets burn\nOn this Saturday night\nBoiling over with anger\nI scream\n\nHonesty is honesty the foundation of respect\nBut none of you would know a thing about that\nIntegrity's exactly what you lack\nWe're not friends\nWe never were\nWe're worlds apart in how we act\nYou might also likeThe hand I've been dealt\nI will play to the best of my ability\nNo one can bluff me into giving up\nCan't stare me down\nWon't ever phase me out\nWhen I know all the tricks of the trade\nAlways one step ahead of the game\nBecause I am a repeat offender of the worst decisions in the world\nCan't believe all the things they said would happen have\nAnd I should know by now\nThat nothing good ever happens after midnight\n\nFertile steps\n\nThe hand I've been dealt\nI will play to the best of my ability\nNo one can bluff me into giving up\nCan't stare me down\nWon't ever phase me out\nWhen I know all the tricks of the trade\nAlways one step ahead of the game\nBecause I am a repeat offender of the worst decisions in the world\nCan't believe all the things they said would happen have\nAnd I should know by now\nThat nothing good ever happens after midnight\nI will take back what they took from meEmbed"}
