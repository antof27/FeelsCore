You 'bout to feel like you battling three of him!\nI'm an egregious reach regent, shit's incredibly real\nThink Glenn from Walking Dead...'cause off the bat, I pop out ahead in the field!\nI mean, shit- let's go!\nI mean, shit, you know the truth\nYou ain't bringing home the views\nBut your vids got a little pop...boy, you're Minnesota Luke!\nI ain't expect a fan to battle me\nI'll crush his hopes; try it\nPut the barrel on him; if he barks, lose the pep, see him go quiet\nWhat's amounting to your weight loss plan?\nHe looks spritely, but don't try it\nWent from Coke, to Diet Coke, to, uh...looks like the Coke Diet!\nAnd you battle to get bitches: that shit is strange, bro\n'Cause they tend to fuck with winners, as if he ain't know\nHe catch her out with his opponents, beat to chick, and stay close\nThen trail her home to see your chance to win a bae go!\nYou trailer-hitchin'\nYour taste in women fit Bates' description: it's misery\nPull my fam with the hammer, there's crazy writtens\nPayment given\nIf you placing him in the same position\nCompare E. Farrell to me, you frontin' bands: it ain't Jane's Addiction!\nI'm playing with him, same with Civic\nCame prepared to snap, star\nI beat poets on the road, so I don't care to act hard\nHe told Reverse he could get laid to rest like lazy sex\nLazy, heh?\nIt's like you're fucking trash, how you're getting laid to waste\nAnd he dump from the hip like old people\nSold that with his typical swag\nNow, boy you thought was cold lost to me: I GOT THIS SHIT IN THE BAG!\n'Cause if he say he pushing beef, he going cow-tippin'\nTalking extra karyotype: down syndrome\nRalph Wiggum 'bout friction?  That's something I doubt, pimpin'\nGo gorilla, just updating this mark's angles: Maoism\nDawg, you getting bodied in a round where I just used four schemes\nGot a grave for this Yankee fitted...and dirt to kick where his dead ass be like a New York meme!\nThat's just salt in the wound\nTout a service, time for sage advice\nAny fan'll tell you that I'm cumin with heat, and you ain't as nice\nThis pap reek of desperation, and now he gon' pay the price\nPaprika?  Chill, E, now Ky and them gotta bump me to raise the spice!\nTalkin' 'bout a Young Spice Rack\nThat's not the punch I pack?\nGonna fuck around and knock your whole bloodline flat!\nI do 'em greasy\nIf it come down to the wire when I'm cooking, it ain't nothing for me to get your grill brushed like that!\nCollision course: the encore'll leave you numb like that\nEmpty bottle: make him wonder where the upside at\nI'll peg this chump's type fast\nYou a punchline cat with a tough-guy act\nThey promised me a main course, now I got a fun-sized pack of sun-dried snacks!\nDie fast\nLet's go!\nYou might also like[Round 1: E.

Farrell]\nOK, so I got some, like, real shit to talk about\u2026\nI always wanted to battle Nat 'cause that's my mother's name...what a shame!\nThis like my fresh white T just got a mustard stain\nMy bars are like sex slaves that escaped (Why's that?)\nThem bitches off the fucking chain!\nAnd got these bums shaking in the streets, with no cup of change\nYOU FUCKING LAME!  Goofy as can be\nFirst opponent I ever had that's got 3-0'd way worse by puberty than me!\nThe type to hit on ten year-olds like it don't seem real crazy\nWith excuses like, \"She said she was a leap-year baby!\"\nMy dude!  That is not the way it works!\nI would normally tell you to grow up, but that would probably make it worse!\nYou live in your grandma's basement and get hassled\nWhen she catches practicing your raps in the mirror...for text battles!\nThat's all facts!\nThat's how we know that you're heartless!\nI bet your Tinder profile says, \"Looking for: Opponents to spar with!\"\nYou have a swear jar at your house, and cannot fight\nYour mousepad's the only place you curse or move a hand on sight!\nThat's all right!\nYour life's an actual circus\nI had to touch on that like screen protectors: barely scratching the surface\nAnd shout-out Cop', but this the match-up that's worthless\n'Cause you had a debatable with a dude who choose to lose EVERY BATTLE ON PURPOSE!\nThat's why he's Kylie Jenner if you heard that 'Lipsis blowing up\nI'll have him die from just a line, like he's sniffing dope that's cut\nBut if he 'bout to get it twisted like he licked an open dutch\nLike a hula girl's top, I'll split this bitch's coconut!\nMalt 40 bust your head: I call that grip a Cobra Clutch\nThen raise fours like skateboard decks: they flipping over trucks\nMilitary-grade straps, and if I lift, the globe is fucked\nI'll have a rack looking different like I hit a Solo cup\nBlack Friday sale: I'll put up on a Target for cheap\nThen peel off on him in the van and leave a mark in the streets\nWith a goon on both sides, both armed with the heat\nThat's three dots in Illipsis' mouth: you are what you eat!\nSee, this what happens when you gassed up and playing with fire\nThey seeing smoke, well, I'm taking it higher\nI won't be satisfied to say I retired\nSo I can go one year without someone misspelling my name on a flyer\nGuys, don't be mad, I'mma say it as well\nI guess I kinda made up for that 'cause I just fucking gave him an L\nSee, this my third main stage-\nHe was supposed to say it\nThis my third main stage, and I ain't give a weak prep\nI put in more leg work than when a millipede steps\nWin, lose, or draw, it's time I get to killing these bets\nSo, with that being said, LIL G'S NEXT!!!\nThat was a great battle and all, but listen, fam\nI ain't gon' share at once if you don't make me some of that fucking food you be posting to Instagram!\nMan, let's go, man!Embed"}
