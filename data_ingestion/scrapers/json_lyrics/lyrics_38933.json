{"Lyrics": "3 ContributorsAnti-Fetish Lyrics(Anti-Fetish)\n\nI've figured out what it all comes down to\n\"And it has nothing to do with us\"\nJealousy is taking over and it makes you feel inadequate\nComparison is the thief of joy\nBut that's exactly how you get your kicks\n\"If you attack them hard enough\"\nMaybe they'll pay you some notice\n\nBut we're not here to feed your fetish\nDon't you look pathetic?\n\"We're not interested in your bullshit\"\nI'm bored, this ain't a competitive sport\nNext question please\nCan't talk without a comparison of\nAll other me's\n\nGet off that pedestal you call your\nFreedom of speech\nI'm sick and tired of hearing about your opinions of me\n\nWe all sound the fucking same so what's the point in trying to stand out?\nAnd we're all just copying each other so listen to one and you've heard all of us\n\nI'm done with hearing I'm not good enough\nThat the quota has been filled\nThere's space for everyone but in your eyes it's kill or be killed\nIt's kill or be killed\nYou might also likeGo on criticize, tell me why\n\nTell me why a fetishism formed on hate and criticism is classed as opinion\nIt's become the new obsession\nIgnoring the discrimination\nJust get a thicker skin\n\nWe're not here to feed your fetish\nDon't you look pathetic?\n\"We're not interested in your bullshit\"\nI'm bored, this ain't a competitive sport\nNext question please\nCan't talk without a comparison of\nAll other me's\n\nGet off that pedestal you call your\nFreedom of speech\nI'm sick and tired of hearing about your opinions of meEmbed"}
