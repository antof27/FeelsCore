Benighted Like Usher]\n\nSnuffed tapers sighed\nAs Death left impressing\nHis crest of cold tears on the Countess\n\nBenighted like ill-fated Usher\nThe House of Bathory shrouded\n'Neath grief's dark facade\n\nIf only I could have wept\nIn mourning by Her side\nI would have clasped Her so tight\nLike storm-beached Aphrodite\nDrowned on Kytherean tides\n\nAnd Kissed Her\nFor from Her alone\nMy lips would have known\nEnigmas of shadowy vistas\nYou might also likeWhere pleasures took flesh\nAnd pain, remorseless\nCame freezing the breath\nOf raucous life hushed unto whispers\n\nBenighted\n\nInhaling the pale waning moonlight that crept\nThrough the crypt of Her Lord who so lucidly slept\n\nBenighted\n\nExhaling the wail of black widowhood's toll\nWaxing eternal night entered Her soul\n\n[Ii. A Murder of Ravens in Fugue]\n\nNow haranguing grey skies\nWith revenge upon life\nGnathic and Sapphic\nNeeds begged gendercide\n\nDelusions of Grandier denounced the revolt\nOf descrying cursed glass, disenchanted in vaults\nEncircled by glyphs midst Her sin-sistered cult\nWith hangman's abandon She plied spiritworlds\nTo Archangels in bondage\nFrom light to night hurled\nCast down to the earth where torment would unfurl.......\n\nBut soon\nHer tarot proved\nHybrid rumours spread like tumours\nWould accrue\nAnd blight Her stars\nHowever scarred\nTo better bitter truths\nOf cold bloodbaths\n\nAs bodies rose\nIn rigid droves\nTo haunt Her from their\nShallow burials imposed\nWhen wolves exhumed\nTheir carthen wombs\nWhere heavy frosts had laboured long\nTo bare their wounds\n\nTo the depths of Her soul they pursued\nWielding their poison they flew\nLike a murder of ravens in fugue\nAnd knowing their raptures\nWould shatter Her dreams\nShe clawed blackened books for damnation's reprieve\nBaneful cawed canons on amassed enemies\n\nSo Hallow's Eve\nAs She received\nLike Bellona to the ball\nThose enemies\nFell-sisters heaved\nHer torturies\nCross stained flagstones\nTo Her carriage reined to flee\n\nBut She knew She must brave the night through\nThough fear crept a deathshead o'er the moon\nLike a murder of ravens in Fugue\n\nFor each masked, jewelled gaze held dread purpose\nHorror froze painted eyes to cold stares\nAnd even Her dance\nIn the vast mirrors cast\nLooked the I'll of Her future\nIf fate feasted there....\n\n[Iii. Eyes That Witnessed Madness]\n\nIn an age crucified by the nails of faith\nWhen rank scarecrows of christ blighted lands\nAn aloof Countess born an obsidian wraith\nDared the abyss knowing well She was damned\nHer life whispered grief like a funeral march\nTwisted and yearning, obsessed an entranced\nWith those succumbing to cruelty\nCrushed 'neath the gait of Her dance\nA whirlwind of fire that swept through the briers\nOf sweet rose Her thickets of black thorn had grasped...\n\nShe demanded the Heavens and forever to glean\nThe elixir of Youth from the pure\nWhilst Her lesbian fantasies\nReamed to extremes\nO'er decades unleashed\nCame for blood's silken cure\n\nBut Her reign ended swiftly\nFor Dark Gods dreamt too deep\nTo heed Her pleas\n\nWhen Her gaolers were assailed\nWith condemnations from a priest\nWho'd stammered rites\nIn the dead of night\nFor maidens staining winding sheets\n\nAnd She postured proud\nWhen Her crimes were trowelled\nAnd jezebelled to peasant lips\nThough She smelt the fires\nThat licked limbs higher\nTo the tortured cunts of accomplices\n\nSo ends this twisted fable's worth\nAnd though spared the pyre's bite\nBy dint of nobled bloodlined birth\nHer sins (crimes) garnered Her no respite\n\nForever severed from the thrill of coming night\nWhere slow Death alone could grant Her flight\n\n\"The Spirits have all but fled judgement\nI rot, alone, insane\nWhere the forest whispers puce laments for me\nFrom amidst the pine and wreathed wolfsbane\nBeyond these walls, wherein condemned\nTo the gloom of an austere tomb\nI pace with feral madness sent\nThrough the pale beams of a guiltless moon\nWho, bereft of necrologies, thus\nCommands creation over the earth\nWhilst I resign my lips to death\nA slow cold kiss that chides rebirth\nThough one last wish is bequathed by fate\nMy beauty shalt wilt, unseen\nSave for twin black eyes that shalt come to take\nMy soul to peace or Hell for company\"\n(To peace or hell for company)\n\nMy soul to Hell for companyEmbed"}
