{"Lyrics": "4 ContributorsCHAIN LyricsBeen broken on the wheel\n(The axe forgets)\nYou cannot tell me how to feel\n(The flesh remembers)\n\nFeel no pain, feel no fear\nYou cannot hurt me anymore\n\nHell waits for no man and neither do I\nThis is where we say goodbye\nWe all have problems and you are mine\nI've chained your bones to the back of my mind\n\nYou did this to yourself\n\nUse a chain so the noose won't snap\nI'll watch you swing and feed the rats\nI tied the knot, I'll watch you rot\nHow deep I dig will never be enoughYou might also likeEmbed"}
