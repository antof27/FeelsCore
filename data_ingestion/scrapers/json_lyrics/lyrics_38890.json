{"Lyrics": "1 ContributorCrooks & The Damned Lyrics[Verse 1]\nCalm Innocence, your confidence is the door\nTo know where you're from\nThe answer resounds\nAnd it\u2019s the way that it sits in my gut\nWe can\u2019t be here right now\nAnd it\u2019s the way that it sifts my blood\nCan I really be in control?\n\n[Chorus]\nWho would ever wanna be\nStuck inside a mind that was built by another person?\nWho would I turn out to be?\nLost without a fire burning bright on the inside\nAnd it\u2019s a long way from the life we were shown\nWho would I turn out to be?\nLost without a fire burning bright on the inside\n\n[Verse 2]\nCrooks and the damned, they\u2019re always on the prowl\nCaught in the con, we lose who we are\nI think I know what I really am\nI can always find true north\nThe fruit is heavy on the branch\nAnd the roots are solid\nYou might also like[Breakdown]\nBreak from the past\nCan we fight? Can we break the cycle?\nWon\u2019t be the one to perpetuate\nThis generational violence\n\n[Chorus]\nWho would ever wanna be\nStuck inside a mind that was built by another person?\nWho would I turn out to be?\nLost without a fire burning bright on the inside\nAnd it\u2019s a long way from the life we were shown\nWho would I turn out to be?\nLost without a fire burning bright on the inside\n\n[Bridge]\nSo we go into the wild and great unknown\nOn our own to build the life that we want to\nSo we go into the wild and great unknown\nOn our own to build the life that we dream of\nTo build the life that we want to\nTo build the life that we dream of\n\n[Chorus]\nWho would ever wanna be\nStuck inside a mind that was built by another person?\nWho would I turn out to be?\nLost without a fire burning bright on the inside\nAnd it\u2019s a long way from the life we were shown\nWho would I turn out to be?\nLost without a fire burning bright on the insideEmbed"}
