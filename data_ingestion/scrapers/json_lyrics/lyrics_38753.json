{"Lyrics": "1 ContributorHomo Deus LyricsI am your god\nYou have to follow me\n\nMy workplace is a bunker\nIt lays six feet\u2005under\nIsolated\u2005from surveillance\nNo trespassing\n\nViolators\u2005will be shot and\nSurvivors will be\u2005shot again\nMaximum discretion\n\nI'm the man standing\nWhen everybody dies\nBow down to your master\nYou will hear the angels cry\n\nI am researching the impossible\nDeciphering the secrets of the supernatural\nNo one will ever witness my creation\nWhen distress and despair are at their low\u0435st point\n\nTaking humanity to the next stage of \u0435volution\nWhether they like it or not\n\nI split the dna\nCross it and create\nA new strain that protects me\nFrom diseases\nYou might also likeA service so elite\nDesigned just for the wealthy\nWe get rid of the vermin\nTo save the one percent\n\nI'm the man standing\nWhen everybody dies\nBow down to your master\nYou will hear the angels cry\n\nA plague more deadly\nThan ever seen before\nDesigned to bring back\nThe balance to the game\n\nWithout sacrifice there is no redemption\nA blackout, the black swan is released\n\nFrom now on\nNature takes its course\nThe human body\nIs a tough machine\n\nI have prepared the dna for the highest\nHighest rate of mortality\nHighest rate of mortality\nVicious infected creatures swarm at night\nOne bite and the metamorphosis begins\nThe body decomposes from the inside\nMore infections fuel contamination\n\nThe doctors can't help\nThey fight for life and death\nIn my bunker I wait for\nThe end of the pandemic\n\nThe infected bodies\nDon\u2019t stay on the ground\nThey rise from the dead\nTo wreak further havoc\n\nThe lust for tasty human flesh\nDrives the lifeless bodies forward\nMy antidote is ineffective\nNow only force of arms can helpEmbed"}
