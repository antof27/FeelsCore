{"Lyrics": "2 ContributorsMuse LyricsThe man of truth has learned that illusion is the one reality and that substance is the great imposter\nIt is inside myself that I must create someone who will understand\nGod damn the rats\nGod damn the world\nGod damn Rotnest\nYou will witness true horror\nNow, rot\n\nI have waited endlessly to exhume my misery\nCrushed beneath the weight of this absurdity\nAnd a life of dissonance\n\nFeeding my resentment left hanging from the gallows I have wrought\nAll for nothing\nPlummeting with one step from the fucking light\n\nPurge my conscience\nErase my identity\n\nI don't want this\nHas this become my fucking paradigm\nExsanguination\nI am finally free\n\nBloodletting for the sake of the muse\nTorture portraitYou might also likeEmbed"}
