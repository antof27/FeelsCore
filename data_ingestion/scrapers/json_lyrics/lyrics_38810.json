{"Lyrics": "8 ContributorsWalk On Lyrics[Sample: [?]]\nPeople, if you wanna go somewhere and you don't have railroad fare, plane fare, train fare, boat fare, or don't have no fare period, there's one way of getting there. I've been using a method for twenty-five years or more, you know, sonny, and it seems to have paid off. Just walk on\n\n[Verse 1: Suffa]\nI speak from the heart, but only when I drink\nAnd I only ever sleep when I'm too tired to think\nRestlessness, the reaction that you will find\nFrom stress I guess and having a compassionate mind\nI worry bout the machine of progress, ain't no stopping it\nThe forest we destroy and the world we build on top of it\nMercenaries get paid salaries to slaughter\nGirls obsessed with body image find calories in water\nNurses comfort seven-year-old casualties of mortar\nA peasant's daughter caught up in a war for a border\nAnd at home we treat our refugees like criminals\nDetention centres just a catch phrase for a minimal\nSecurity prison, we drive gold trimmed cars\nDown the road an Afghani kid grows up behind bars\nAnd we wonder why they hate the west (wonder)\nWhen we treat them like they're second-class citizens at best, we're all\nPawns in a game, the USAs miniatures\nAussie foreign policy with George Bush's signature\nPeeps die for a watch and blue chip stock\nDid they do Big Pop or was it two-bit cops\nI wanna sue kid rock for making rednecks think they're hip hop\nWanna swallow people's pain and spit it from the hilltop\nWanna affect change in the subjects that we talk on\nConnect strangers, work together and walk on\nYou might also like[Scratches: DJ Next]\n\"And you don't quit, don't stop\"\n\"And you don't quit, don't stop\"\n\"And you don't quit, don't stop\"\n\"And you don't quit, don't stop\"\n\n[Verse 2: Pressure]\nPolluting airways, mankind strays with no reforming\nSo slap on that sunscreen and enjoy the global warming\n'Cause ignoring world issues is what we all do best\nJust like Aussie politicians shoe shining for the U.S\nTo save losing face, no thoughts to the fumes that trace\nOur sky lines and clogs our seas we swimming in consumer waste\nThe fumes of hate rise globally but will it cease\nThe day we try and find a little peace within the Middle East\nWe shadow their borders yelling, \"Deplete their arms\"\nIts just war for black gold so they can grease their palms\nWe all need a scapegoat, a villain to cop blame\nWe're just wolves in sheep's clothing killing in God's name\nAnd that's worldwide, like global overpopulation\nWe mine the world dry of natural resources to feed our nations\nAppetite for waste, I see it everywhere\nI feel like throwing a flag of protest in Tienanmen Square\nWe need to care for mother earth and all of her natural defences\nBut talk is cheap, and taking action is expensive\nWe wear our hearts on our sleeves, our flags on our borders\nAnd that's why nuclear testing's done in Pacific foreign waters\nWe follow reporters with the worth of a scholar\nAnd gather personal opinions from a rag worth a dollar\nMan this is not a subject I feel lightly I can talk on\nThe attitude is one man of many (right), so walk on\n[Scratches: DJ Next]\n\"And you don't quit, don't stop\"\n\"And you don't quit, don't stop\"\n\"And you don't quit, don't stop\"\n\"And you don't quit, don't stop\"2Embed"}
