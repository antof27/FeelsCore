{"Lyrics": "3 ContributorsKing Of The Night Lyrics[Produced by Aguila Beats]\n\n[Verse 1]\nTime is up, the light is dying\nDarkness closes in, the world is quiet\nSitting in the spot, everyone desires\nEveryone could get it, but everyone's too tired\nI'm what people don't like seeing\nA divine being\nLook inside my head, give yo ass a tour, take you sight seeing\nHa, for the time being, I'll lock myself up with my feelings\nThen put that on a beat and see if I made it through for the right reasons\nUh\n\n[Hook]\nIn the darkest hours, I have got all the power\nThe light doesn't enter in my, ivory tower\nWelcome to my kingdom\nWelcome to my life\nAdress me as your highness, I'm the, king of the night\nNo one here can touch me\nNo one here can near me\nNo one here to love me\nNobody can hear me\nUnbeatable, untouchable, the dream of the Earth\nCause (everybody wants to rule the world)\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nThis is how it's been from the start\nNo sound, no lights, nothing but the stars\nHighway 'round the corner, but I don't hear any cars\nLocked up tight, but I don't see any bars\nThe world is my kingdom, this is my palace\nI have been searched by No Malice\nCrown on my head, in my hand is a chalice\nMOTHAFUCKA, YOU JEALOUS?!\nI don't do no taxes... I DON'T PAY NO FEES\nI'm not religiouuuuus, cause GOD PRAYS TO ME\nAL PRAISE TO ME... ALL PRAISE TO ME\nCause I work all niiiight, NO OFF DAYS FOR ME\nAnd no one can touch me, love me or stop me\nThis is my paradise, bitch, no Yahtzee\nOnly general with the age of draftee\nThis isn't how I want it, this is how it must be\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nLarry, Rodney, Stephen, Martin\nQuite some footsteps that I have to walk in\nBB, BJ, Bern and Don(BJ = Billie Jean King, Bern = Bernard King)\nYeah, it's quite the legacy to carry on\nLife's a bitch and I hit her, like Barry Bonds\nGet that pussy mo' wet, Dom Perignon\nProvide that bitch a new pair of Brian's\nThen proceed the process with a pair of dimes\nPlan my palace as the place to be\nParty with a pretty princess with a face to see\nPoppin' Perrier at the pace to beat\nThe peak's perfect, probably the place for me\nThere's no trace of me for you nationals\nWith your small brains, talking irrational\nI'm a mogul, you a muggle, I'm magical\nYou're no Mads/match to me, cause I'm Hannibal\nCrazy, I am crazy\nLord of the darkness, I'm Hades\nPull game's gotten lazy\nDon't try and still end up with ladies\nHeir, when you see the stars in the air\nMy sceptre's the mic and the throne's my chair\nYes, I'm fresh, so the people, they stare\nBut I'm a fuckin' king, so no Bel-Air\nSo impressive, even Arthur's scared\nRound table paled to a bunch of squares\nI decide who gets killed or spared\nI told y'all, I receive God his prayers\nKing\n[Hook]Embed"}
