{"Lyrics": "1 ContributorGrimace LyricsCan I have your\nHave your attention please?\nIt's been a great night\nAnd I regret to leave\nBut I don't have\nLet's say \"the expertise\"\nFor this\n\nSo, can I have your\nHave your attention please?\nIs my soul under warranty?\nI'm freaking out, where's my receipt?\nYeah, this is happening\n\nAlways just one pound short on the weigh in\nLeave me here man I'm dying\nLeave me here man I'm dying, you know\n\nI've created a problem\nYou think that I'm someone else\nAnd you can't tell\nBut darling what a show\nSo keep your crown if you've got one\nI'll be here kicking by myself\nAnd just as well\nI've got to let it go\nI've got to let it go\nYou might also likeDirty laundry, skeletons in the back\nSo many secrets, too many to keep track\nIf you can't hear it, the targets on your back\nIt's on your back\n\nAlways just one pound short on the weigh in\nGrimace so hard I'm smiling\nGrimace so hard I'm smiling, you know\n\nI've created a problem\nYou think that I'm someone else\nAnd you can't tell\nBut darling what a show\nSo keep your crown if you've got one\nI'll be here kicking by myself\nAnd just as well\n\nBet it feels good\nUntil the spotlight hits your eyes\nYou never saw it coming\nYou tried with all your might\nIn the end it all meant nothing\n\nTen years or a thousand\nIt's all the same bittersweet, bloody sheets\nI'm incomplete and can't compete but\nNever mind, I'll choose to stay blind to the past\nI don't know who I am but you didn't ask\nI've created a problem\nYou think that I'm someone else\nAnd you can't tell\nYou know it's hard to be yourself\nSo keep your crown if you've got one\nI'll be here kicking by myself\nAnd just as well\n\nBut letting go was never something I could do so well\nBut if all the lighting's right then nobody can tell\nLetting go was never something I could do so well\nBut if all the lighting's right then nobody can tellEmbed"}
