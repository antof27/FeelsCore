{"Lyrics": "2 ContributorsChoky LyricsTake it from me, bitch\nYou're never gonna change\nBuilding bars inside your skull and now you're living in a cage (Shit)\nThis is exactly why you never fucking learn a thing\nSame old story going messing up your life again\n\nStupid child\nBlame it on\nAnyone else\nPsychopath\n\nIn the corner, do not feel welcome (Why?)\nWhy am I like this? (Why the fuck?)\nThis is pure agony (I fucking hate this)\nAnd where is the nearest exit? (Get me)\nGet me the fuck out of here\nI just can't take anoth\u0435r second of this torture\nSelf inflict\u0435d, I think I might be addicted to this pain\nWill it ever go away?\nWill it ever go away?\nWill it ever go away?\n\nShame, disgrace\nShame, disgrace\n\nI despise you\nEvil fuck\nTake me (Take me)\nYou might also likeHigh, just to plunge me back into darkness\nWhy do I feel like I've been here before?\nNo control anymore\nLonely boy, are you happy with yourself now?\nHow does it feel now you got everything that you asked for?\n\nMaybe they're right?\nMaybe I'm crazy?\nWhat if I'm sat on the edge of fucking insanity?\nMaybe I've lost it?\nMaybe I'm coming undone? (Maybe I'm sick)\nMaybe I'm fucked\n\nWhy would you take it from me? (Fuck)\nI've lost my fucking mind\nI've done made this jail my home and you will never get inside (Inside)\nFuck you, I don't need no more advice cause you know I'm already way too far gone\nAnd one day\n\nI just won't wake up\n\nSick of feeling empty\nSame mistakes have got me feeling\nI might never be the same\nUnless I do something about it\nJust that no-one hears these voices\nCause they're all up in my head and\nThey ain't they ain't talking to nobody but\nMeEmbed"}
