Joy was in his mien.\nForth of the flame he stood upon the brink,\nAnd with a voice, whose lively clearness far\nSurpass'd our human, \"Blessed are the pure\nIn heart,\" he Sang: then near him as we came,\n\"Go ye not further, holy spirits!\"  he cried,\n\"Ere the fire pierce you: enter in; and list\nAttentive to the song ye hear from thence.\"\n\nI, when I heard his saying, was as one\nLaid in the grave.  My hands together clasp'd,\nAnd upward stretching, on the fire I look'd,\nAnd busy fancy conjur'd up the forms\nErewhile beheld alive consum'd in flames.\n\nTh' escorting spirits turn'd with gentle looks\nToward me, and the Mantuan spake: \"My son,\nHere torment thou mayst feel, but canst not death.\nRemember thee, remember thee, if I\nSafe e'en on Geryon brought thee: now I come\nMore near to God, wilt thou not trust me now?\nOf this be sure: though in its womb that flame\nA thousand years contain'd thee, from thy head\nNo hair should perish.  If thou doubt my truth,\nApproach, and with thy hands thy vesture's hem\nStretch forth, and for thyself confirm belief.\nLay now all fear, O lay all fear aside.\nTurn hither, and come onward undismay'd.\"\nI still, though conscience urg'd' no step advanc'd.\nWhen still he saw me fix'd and obstinate,\nSomewhat disturb'd he cried: \"Mark now, my son,\nFrom Beatrice thou art by this wall\nDivided.\"  As at Thisbe's name the eye\nOf Pyramus was open'd (when life ebb'd\nFast from his veins), and took one parting glance,\nWhile vermeil dyed the mulberry; thus I turn'd\nTo my sage guide, relenting, when I heard\nThe name, that springs forever in my breast.\n\nHe shook his forehead; and, \"How long,\" he said,\n\"Linger we now?\"  then smil'd, as one would smile\nUpon a child, that eyes the fruit and yields.\nInto the fire before me then he walk'd;\nAnd Statius, who erewhile no little space\nHad parted us, he pray'd to come behind.\n\nI would have cast me into molten glass\nTo cool me, when I enter'd; so intense\nRag'd the conflagrant mass.  The sire belov'd,\nTo comfort me, as he proceeded, still\nOf Beatrice talk'd.  \"Her eyes,\" saith he,\n\"E'en now I seem to view.\"  From the other side\nA voice, that sang, did guide us, and the voice\nFollowing, with heedful ear, we issued forth,\nThere where the path led upward.  \"Come,\" we heard,\n\"Come, blessed of my Father.\"  Such the sounds,\nThat hail'd us from within a light, which shone\nSo radiant, I could not endure the view.\n\"The sun,\" it added, \"hastes: and evening comes.\nDelay not: ere the western sky is hung\nWith blackness, strive ye for the pass.\"  Our way\nUpright within the rock arose, and fac'd\nSuch part of heav'n, that from before my steps\nThe beams were shrouded of the sinking sun.\nNor many stairs were overpass, when now\nBy fading of the shadow we perceiv'd\nThe sun behind us couch'd: and ere one face\nOf darkness o'er its measureless expanse\nInvolv'd th' horizon, and the night her lot\nHeld individual, each of us had made\nA stair his pallet: not that will, but power,\nHad fail'd us, by the nature of that mount\nForbidden further travel.  As the goats,\nThat late have skipp'd and wanton'd rapidly\nUpon the craggy cliffs, ere they had ta'en\nTheir supper on the herb, now silent lie\nAnd ruminate beneath the umbrage brown,\nWhile noonday rages; and the goatherd leans\nUpon his staff, and leaning watches them:\nAnd as the swain, that lodges out all night\nIn quiet by his flock, lest beast of prey\nDisperse them; even so all three abode,\nI as a goat and as the shepherds they,\nClose pent on either side by shelving rock.\n\n\n\nA little glimpse of sky was seen above;\nYet by that little I beheld the stars\nIn magnitude and rustle shining forth\nWith more than wonted glory.  As I lay,\nGazing on them, and in that fit of musing,\nSleep overcame me, sleep, that bringeth oft\nTidings of future hap.  About the hour,\nAs I believe, when Venus from the east\nFirst lighten'd on the mountain, she whose orb\nSeems always glowing with the fire of love,\nA lady young and beautiful, I dream'd,\nWas passing o'er a lea; and, as she came,\nMethought I saw her ever and anon\nBending to cull the flowers; and thus she sang:\n\"Know ye, whoever of my name would ask,\nThat I am Leah: for my brow to weave\nA garland, these fair hands unwearied ply.\nTo please me at the crystal mirror, here\nI deck me.  But my sister Rachel, she\nBefore her glass abides the livelong day,\nHer radiant eyes beholding, charm'd no less,\nThan I with this delightful task.  Her joy\nIn contemplation, as in labour mine.\"\nAnd now as glimm'ring dawn appear'd, that breaks\nMore welcome to the pilgrim still, as he\nSojourns less distant on his homeward way,\nDarkness from all sides fled, and with it fled\nMy slumber; whence I rose and saw my guide\nAlready risen.  \"That delicious fruit,\nWhich through so many a branch the zealous care\nOf mortals roams in quest of, shall this day\nAppease thy hunger.\"  Such the words I heard\nFrom Virgil's lip; and never greeting heard\nSo pleasant as the sounds.  Within me straight\nDesire so grew upon desire to mount,\nThenceforward at each step I felt the wings\nIncreasing for my flight.  When we had run\nO'er all the ladder to its topmost round,\nAs there we stood, on me the Mantuan fix'd\nHis eyes, and thus he spake: \"Both fires, my son,\nThe temporal and eternal, thou hast seen,\nAnd art arriv'd, where of itself my ken\nNo further reaches.  I with skill and art\nThus far have drawn thee.  Now thy pleasure take\nFor guide.  Thou hast o'ercome the steeper way,\nO'ercome the straighter.  Lo! the sun, that darts\nHis beam upon thy forehead! lo! the herb,\nThe arboreta and flowers, which of itself\nThis land pours forth profuse! Till those bright eyes\nWith gladness come, which, weeping, made me haste\nTo succour thee, thou mayst or seat thee down,\nOr wander where thou wilt.  Expect no more\nSanction of warning voice or sign from me,\nFree of thy own arbitrement to choose,\nDiscreet, judicious.  To distrust thy sense\nWere henceforth error.  I invest thee then\nWith crown and mitre, sovereign o'er thyself.\"Embed"}
