{"Lyrics": "1 ContributorDeath by Seven LyricsUnmistakable\n\nThey say that money is the root of all evil\nWho are you to judge?\nLove is the poison of your apple\nWhen you decide to take the jump\nWhat doesn't kill you\nIs the spoil of your own existence\nYou can choose to keep it real\nOr choose to live in your falsified cathedral\n\nJustified crucifixion\nThis is your cross to bear\nMisguided jurisdiction\nHell is a place for a scum bent on revenge\nJustified crucifixion\nThis is your cross to bear\nFear rising, suffocating\nBlessed be the one left standing\n\nIt always ends the same\n\nPride to feed your ego\nEnvy to kill the lack of one's soul\nLaze these nights away\nWith a belly full of snakes\nYou might also likeThis world will watch you burn or watch you decay\nThe only chance for you to save your life or fade to grey\n\nJust know that when all else fails\nThere will be wrath and the fury\nWhen all else fails\nNothing left but your body to bury\n\nThrough the depths of hell\nAll evil stems from the same\nThrough the fire and the flames\nYou only have yourself to blame\nThrough the depths of hell\nAll evil stems from the same\nThrough the fire and the flames\nYou only have yourself to blame\n\nYour sins will not be forgivenEmbed"}
