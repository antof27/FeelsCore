{"Lyrics": "1 ContributorMother Pt. 4 LyricsOut in the vacuum of time, we fly\nWe fly\nInto the solar light (Into the solar light)\nSo divine\nWe fly (Into the solar light)\n\nWhat are we soon to face?\nDeep space, pressurized intake\nDeprive me of oxygen\nNo, not again\n\nGrab ahold\nBrace for impact\n\nThis objective is for all mankind\nThis ambition, will it save us?\n\nI'm absent on the inside\nIt's showing on the outside\nThis crater I\u2019m in (Crater I\u2019m in)\nIt's only growing deeper\nMy bones are growing weaker\nSo desolate\n\nWe're drifting further into oblivion\nThe weight (The weight)\nThat we carry with us\nHeavy on our minds\nYou might also likeCrash into the surface\nBlacked out\n\nThrough life's burden\nThe times uncertain\nIt all keeps turning\nExistence\nSo distant\n\nLives that we've lost\nAll for this\nWars that we've fought\nJust to live\n\nLife always finds a way\nTime is a traveled space\n\nWhat are we soon to face?\nDeep space, pressurized intake\nDeprive me of oxygen\nNo, not again\nGrab ahold\nAnd brace for impact\nDeep into oblivionEmbed"}
