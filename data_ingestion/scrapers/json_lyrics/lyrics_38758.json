It\u2019s like the darkest recesses of the site came out for sunlight\nRegardless, the killer lurks, leaving you riveted like Rosie, biologically shocking, Big Daddy of sin like I pimped out E-V-E\nI\u2019m flipping dopamine and Adam, while Toronto\u2019s creating shit like he\u2019s finger to finger with God, not E.T\nChef\u2019s in Shambles, flamingly flagrant, because Shaolin Land\u2019s just rambles, faker than China Town\nAll Caps needs a paper bag mask after he rapped that ragged trash, even MF DOOM would frown\nThe cacodemon\u2019s furnace of hell melting y\u2019all like the wicked witch, everyone else\u2019s bars akin to how the Cowardly Lion would sound\nI hand out the L\u2019s and y\u2019all add the \u201cGBT\u201d, but I\u2019ve got a Q for you vacuous queers;\nHow come all your bars are looking more androgynous than David Bowie and Young M.A.\u2019s tears?\nChef is serving me with shit softer than butterscotchpie\u2019s bars and AVI alike\nJason Voorhees and I, eviscerating you invertebrates, spinal tapping, draining your marrow left and right\nShaolin Chef, the self-proclaimed mediator OG, slaving on a site for free, too damn hardcore for me\nIsn\u2019t your job to dissolve contention?\nWe\u2019re supposed to disregard IQ and judge by character? And not mention Jay\u2019s 10x the person you are in both regards?\nYou\u2019re an empty book, cover to cover so there\u2019s nothing other to judge by, all your disses are ambiguous cause you seemingly can\u2019t read\nGoing AWOL as I leave y\u2019all deserted, MIA, with a mental breakdown like Bowe Bergdahl\nSwapping this criminality for everybody\u2019s pusillanimity, you gotta be kidding me, I\u2019ll pretend like I never heard y\u2019all\nFirst, Jay called out Master Chef Junior on his bullshit, then the whole site turned into an amalgamation of retardation\nIndirect cross-dissing with logical bars missing, non-sequitur, labyrinthine garbage like every bar is penned by ALLCAPSification\nIn all honesty, I hate all of you and didn\u2019t even wanna do this, but when the KING calls his Kut-Throat I\u2019m happy to oblige\nIrreverent misanthrope\u2019s not too much of a misnomer but at least I\u2019m not jacking it to hentai, playing Janet Jackson and Mary J. Blige\nGlad Shaolin can drop a track, dissing the whole site right before I throw this shit out here so it looks like I wasn\u2019t writing this before him\nEverybody\u2019s switching poles like ChannelPINK\u2019s role on the site, and every script is valued less than his opinions on the forum\n30 tracks of full circle, turn the corner fuck around, everybody\u2019s spread eagle, face down like Whitney Houston, that\u2019s my fucking problem A$AP\nIs this in good spirit anymore? Leaps of logic are abundant like a Michael Strahan/Bobby Christina Brown tooth gap\nCanadians Can\u2019t Clap, claims the misguided mistake of majuscule, All Caps\nDunno why Onemandhandjob came in here at all, whitehats dicking around in this mediator circle jerk, at least JC Assassin was giving everyone dirt naps\nDunno why ScopeY thought his input was valued, his bars leave you feeling more violated than wire taps\nDunno why Gabbles kept his references infantile, thankfully Vesuvius could divulge his spiteful crap\nDunno why Zade, JC and Dayer were the only ones with respectably written bars in their raps\n72 bars is how you make a murderer, but this shit never ends like Steven Avery\u2019s court proceedings\n27 Club literally has more bodies than anyone of you people have written, Cobain\u2019s got half a mind to stop reading\nNevertheless, the omnipotent Daemonum only entered in to drain your jugular and abscond\nGenius meets the KING and the Kut-Throat, we\u2019ll always have dominion over you vagabondsYou might also likeEmbed"}
