{"Lyrics": "5 ContributorsTheory of Mind Lyrics[Intro]\nMonkey see, monkey do\nSo who the fuck made you? (So who the fuck made you?)\nIt feels like a thousand years since I fell in love\nBut when the push comes to shove, love will never be enough\nLove will never be enough\nLove will never be\n\n[Verse 1]\nEnough, enough, enough, enough\nTime to call your bluff\nCut the shit and readjust\nLove will never be\nEnough, enough, enough, enough\nLetting go is tough\nHolding on is just as rough\nWhen you're cold to the touch\nHow much can a heart take before a heart breaks?\nAttain a gaze I can\u2019t sustain while I\u2019m\nJust playin' the same damn game\n'Til I run away at a single drop of rain\n\n[Breakdown]\nDrop it\nYou do what you can\nAnd I'll bring the big sorrow\nPush it\nTo the edge\nForge a crown from the meltdown (Meltdown)\nPlay the game, say my name, bitch\nNo queen and no offspring\nAll hail the endling, let your balls swing\nIt\u2019s all the same\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nTime to let go, time to cut the cord\nWhen love runs its course\nFoolish for no one (No one)\nMonkey bleeds, monkey lose\nTrying so hard to\nJust take this ache away\nAnd build a better place\nWhere we belong\nInstead I put my head through the walls\n\n[Breakdown]\nAlone\nLove will never be\nLove will never be\nBitch\nFuck what I say, never here to stay\nJust a bunch of bullshit to take the pain away\nTemporary fix focused on the outside\nWhile the soft bits left rot away on the inside\nFuck thatEmbed"}
