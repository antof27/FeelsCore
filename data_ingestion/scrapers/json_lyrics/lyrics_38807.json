{"Lyrics": "1 ContributorDoom Sequence LyricsWhat you see is the darkness filling the room\nAs you look on and see death\u2019s dying embrace\nI was left there helpless\nWatching my life flash before my eyes\n\nFlesh feels like it\u2019s starting to turn\nA cold sweat, panic shakes\nSmoke fills the room\n\nBlood stained hands\nCleanse me of endless contrition\nVoid shadows, pulsating\nConstraining my essence\nFeeling their souls deranged\nTheir piercing eyes follow me\nAlways forced to exist in doom\n\nWe live in doom\n\nDidn\u2019t I tell you not to look at the walls\n\nDidn\u2019t I tell you not to look at the walls\nDidn\u2019t I tell you not to look at all\nBecause now you have to encompass the pain and hate\nThat consumes us all\nYou might also likeBlood stained hands\nCleanse me of endless contrition\nVoid shadows, pulsating\nConstraining my essence\nFeeling their souls deranged\nTheir piercing eyes follow me\nAlways forced to exist in doom\n\nBlood stained hands\nCleanse me of endless contrition\nVoid shadows, pulsating\nConstraining my essence\nFeeling their souls deranged\nTheir piercing eyes follow me\nAlways forced to exist in doom\n\nHere is the table where you will lay\nAgain and again encompassed by pain\nCommit to meEmbed"}
