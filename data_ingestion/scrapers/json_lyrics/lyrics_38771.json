Weather treasure\nIntelligence, benevolence, it's earthquakes measured\nAnother Mason president with secret pieces of the crucifix\nOn the cruise ship to Egypt in 2000, in public-housing\nIt's propaganda in a slick disguised, as entertainment\nRated R, ain't that bizarre?\nDesensitized to space ships\nA nuclear device headed for Jupiter\nWhile network TV keeps us stupider\nIt's humans spayed and neutered, it's your baby's future\nThe eye inside the pyramid, the spy inside your crib\nYou might also like[Verse 2: Kobayashi]\nMerely running a cyber race, as I stare off into space\nOne day my life they'll cut and paste\nFormat and download to her place\nCopy to floppy disc\nShe plays a game, her life at Risk\nWatch my foes through the mist\nSurround mounds of secret data\nFought to fought the one and other, mix shit, I own all to big brother\nThe biggest player hater\nKeep three economic terminators\nExterminator of lower class and its invisible system of caste\nWhere the rich get richer meanwhile the poor just get their picture\nIn the local Times\nFor murder one to petty crimes\nInterest rates climb\nTo keep you borrowing all the time\nAt night a light shines\nInfrared inspection of the mind's contents\nNonsense to tappin a line all the time\nTo control our life with nine numbers, concerns towards are gettin numb\nAs the market starts to plunder\nI wonder where this world goes and realize\nTime will expose all they try to keep hidden\nSo peep the knowledge god's spittin\nAnother world's in store\nThey can't be won without a war with revelations for more\nScan your card at the store, fingerprints to open a door\nE-ZPass so you can pass, help eliminate cash\nFrom keepin' tabs on yo' ass, everywhere you go, swiping cards\nSpending virtual dough brought of interactive tracking\nConducted on the low, hi-tech hacking\nResults in encrypted codes crackin' now we have no defense\nAnd our backs against the fence a l\u00e1 Prince\nComputers so real that they can talk\nLeave mankind alive in chalk\nPatricians getting dark\n[Interlude]\n\"It's believed that these changes are so subtle\nThat they have already begun taking effect and\nThe makings of a new sociable state\nAre in fact already among us\"\n\n[Verse Three: Trip]\nEverybody flip a dollar over, scrutinize it\nSee the truth, realize the cyclopic optic in the socket\nThat's tri-angular watch the Ken Star spangle\nPresentangle strangle\nYour computer data, basically, replace the power with Armageddon\nFuck that I'ma get this\nCall it armageddon, next tip let's get out of here\nIt's crowded here, too many cats runnin around the sphere\nChained to a currency, centered around the sphere burnin eternally\nAlthough you think it's turning the globe it's spinnin is really controlled\nBy those who lead the mislead\nAs tricknology gets fed through the mouths of microchips\nAnd their fiber opt, tickin testin clock tickin\nPlot thicken like cock when it's leaving crotch, it's feminine\nWatch millenium watch your pendium, cash freeze zero degrees\nLike prime meridian\nI pity slum and citizens who wanna know\nY2K fucked up they wanna know B-I-N-A-R-Y digital\nEven though the environment is [?] compliance with\nHigher enlightenment\nMy mind is in sent\nDaily types of messages, I soak it all up\nBut I filter\nNever caught up in contest fax with overlappin infractions\nMade objections\nPopulace subtraction creatin a class that lacks action\nMold the world by what you tellin it meltin it swellin it\nWatch all the dwellin it verbal relevant\nUse verbal elements that confuse, arrest development\nOf you intelligence you assumin that you can fuck with the Illumen'\nBut they celibate, secretly\nShhhhhhhEmbed"}
