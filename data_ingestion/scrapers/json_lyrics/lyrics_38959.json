{"Lyrics": "1 ContributorAmongst Phantom Worlds LyricsI revolted with the Earth in uncertainty and without name\nI have lived my lives without counts\nMy life, just a second of a dream in trans-stellar space\nA little stop on a way from one unknown chasm to the other\n\nFragile pulsation of my anti-life, vagueness of crystal-clear oblivion from which the temptress-life has called me for one short unfortunate instant\n\nIn a frenzy of despair, in oppressive dismal atmosphere of seclusion, in a lack of interest in life\nWithout stimulus, yearnings and hopes I continue my way through deep space and parallel horizons neither dead nor dreaming\n\nThousand times for one my breath madness and unmadness has traded places\nI'm a source of unpurity\nMy world, a veil which hid cosmic chaos\nI'm ritual, reiterate dead world's mantra:\n\"That is not dead which can eternal lie and with strange aeons even death may die\"\n\nMagical blood rised from the depths of my heart\nI revive the world with my blood\nI call my name by myselfYou might also likeEmbed"}
