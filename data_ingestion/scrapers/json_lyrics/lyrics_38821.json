{"Lyrics": "1 ContributorHalf Alive LyricsI'm half alive inside my soul\nCause I've been drifting in the dark of the unknown\n\nI'm half alive\n\nI am afraid that\nOne day all that I have is getting lost\nTo something, like a sickness from out of nothing\nDon't even know it exists\nBut now it paralyzed the world around me\n\nNot a cure, not a remedy\nIt's growing slow deep inside of me\nAnd cut the line when I'm least expecting\n\nI'm a phantom of myself\nA ghost inside a shell\nWill you help me out\n\nI'm half alive inside my soul\nCause I've been drifting in the dark of the unknown\nI\u2019m paralyzed with nowhere to go\nYeah I've been hanging on a thread since you've been gone\nBleeding in my bones\n\nThere is a close for all of us\nI feel it in the distance\nWaiting and well prepared\nTake my life and drag me under\nNumb to the core\nCan you fix my soul\nYou might also likeCause I'm running out of control\n\nI'm half alive inside my soul\nCause I've been drifting in the dark of the unknown\nI\u2019m paralyzed with nowhere to go\nYeah I've been hanging on a thread since you've been gone\nBleeding in my bones\n\nNumb to the core, can you fix my soul\nI need to let go of what has been done, has been done before\nLost all I\u2019ve got, can't move anymore\nAnd all I give is way to the pain, to the only thing I know\n\nNot a cure, not a remedy\nIt's growing slow deep inside of me\nKneel down, for all to see\nBliss is a heresy\n\nI'm a phantom of myself\nA ghost inside a shell\nCan you help me out\n\nI'm half alive inside my soul\nCause I've been drifting in the dark of the unknown\nI\u2019m paralyzed with nowhere to go\nYeah I've been hanging on a thread since you've been gone\nBleeding in my bonesEmbed"}
