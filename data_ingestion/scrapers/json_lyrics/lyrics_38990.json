{"Lyrics": "1 ContributorBad Attitude LyricsINTRO\nI need someone to ease my pain\nMy dreams were burnt with propane\nI Keep my eyes low,i always obey the law\nI like to be raw,many vows that i spit come through my jaw\nThe lost ones killed their own future \nThey ain't the chosen ones,they're mature\nNasty like a gangsta,i'm in that mood sometimes\nI'm hiding in the heaven's arms\nJust to get back to my ol' life that used to harm\n\n\n\n\nVerse 1\n\nI pay sins with nightmares\nThey are walking upside down like dementors, no stares\nDrinking alcohol i can't feel the poison\nFuckers asking for taxes\nYeah stop complaining you ain't high on molasses\nIm street educated lemme murder the mic\nShit don't turn me up i'm on my worst behavior\nYou can send my crimes in jail\nBut don't expect from me to hail\nMy daily glance goes like occam's razor\nOr like a man murdered by his own thoughts\nI just keep my shit tight\nThinking what the fuck i will do this night\nGraves are watching every movement till death\nBet you can never see godfather's laugh\nI never pray for the rich , i pray for my fam\nCuz the weak will become rich as fuck because they flam\nSick of helping people for no reason\nCuz they they are watching like you are the illusion\nYeah i still wake up in days of confusion\nAccused because i learned my lesson\nAmused because you can never trick me again, son\nTon of white ass kids acting cocky\nI just want them to disembody\nLooking at my scars they are just wicked\nLike the devil who waits for your mistakes to be committed\nYeah this shit is stuck in my mind\nYou should forget my name\nU can call me Mr treat ya nose or Mr blame\nShit that's a certain thing\nDon't forget that i got a bad attitude cuz i'ma king\nYou might also likeVerse 2\n\nI'm a regular guy who fucks with your opinion\nLucifer is my enemy illuminati is a blasphemy\nSoon the earth will disappear with its ancestors\nCurse the pride , serve to survive\nMelodramatic like a spartan \"u won't get me alive\"\nBeware cerberus is here i don't fucking care\nFeed the audience with bars\nFuck their rumours i shoot dem stars\nBitch i'm different i got the motivation\nFellas are crystallizing an image next to my constellation\nYou can hate me more meaning you can never have my galore\nI give them what they need an honest speech\nThey want to compete with me i paid my well-doings to the inquisitor\nThey still want to reach\nI like to plant bombs because i live in shitsville\nThey don't stink they just kill\nI want to reach the top , but not the everest\nYeah i try to remain thre , but this shit won't ever last\nCarried guns loaded with justice\nI can even kill my country cuz im cold as ice\nRoll the dice, what do i got\nAnother catastrophe happened what do you fight against?\nI've got a bad attitude about drugs\nFuck you what comes next\nThat dying chose the living world for text\nNow i'm wasted, i should create a testimony for those who i hate\nThey think i'm notorious, my state of mind has a high criminality rate\nFuck the world and his ignorants\nMy flow is meant to blow 10 times in a row\nWow, i got mind full of words i will use it as bow\nFuck i define foes and hoes by them character\nMy moment will die when we will be happily ever after\nNow my agony turned into a beast\nGod has an empty chair for me at his feast\nVerse 3\nI can shit on your wonton soup\nYou can sit next to yeezus and basedgod wanking on that softporn loop\nUnsigned hype dope as cocaine\nI can destroy your favorite rapper like Johnny Coltrane\nGive me a mic and laptop so i could remain in this domain\nI donate and rotate my raps like a doctor who grooms and mutates\nI spit lyrics similar to Obama spittin verbs and sentences\nIf you a hater,you don't prosper in my world,prognosis\nStop living your life in a nutshell\nTake my nuts,i sent yours to hell\nNo turn back, you've turned whack\nLemme put my Freddie Krueger on\nWith a little bit of Gandhi on\nMy knowledge is gonna break and take your life\nYou can take your drake and bake he's fake\nI'm bad even though my flow was sent from heaven\nWorking on my smile like a stranger in the night\nA frank sinatra opening chakras in the light\n47 my higher self,maybe that's an ego with a lot of wealth\nAn ego from the future which gain more culture\nThan a Reagan hoppin on a wagon representing the vulture\nBringing you the high fever\nForever,baby don't bring that shitty beaver bieber ever\nCuz this song might reminiscence the school where u used to stay on loser's stool\nFOOL,don't call yourself a coon just cuz you heard of the word NEGUSEmbed"}
