{"Lyrics": "47 ContributorsUlysses (Chap. 9 - Scylla and Charybdis) LyricsUrbane, to comfort them, the quaker librarian purred:\n\n\u2014And we have, have we not, those priceless pages of Wilhelm Meister. A great poet on a great brother poet. A hesitating soul taking arms against a sea of troubles, torn by conflicting doubts, as one sees in real life.\n\nHe came a step a sinkapace forward on neatsleather creaking and a step backward a sinkapace on the solemn floor.\n\nA noiseless attendant setting open the door but slightly made him a noiseless beck.\n\n\u2014Directly, said he, creaking to go, albeit lingering. The beautiful ineffectual dreamer who comes to grief against hard facts. One always feels that Goethe's judgments are so true. True in the larger analysis.\nTwicreakingly analysis he corantoed off. Bald, most zealous by the door he gave his large ear all to the attendant's words: heard them: and was gone.\n\nTwo left.\n\n\u2014Monsieur de la Palice, Stephen sneered, was alive fifteen minutes before his death.\n\n\u2014Have you found those six brave medicals, John Eglinton asked with elder's gall, to write Paradise Lost at your dictation? The Sorrows of Satan he calls it.\n\nSmile. Smile Cranly's smile.\n\nFirst he tickled her\nThen he patted her\nThen he passed the female catheter.\nFor he was a medical\nJolly old medi...\n\n\u2014I feel you would need one more for Hamlet. Seven is dear to the mystic mind. The shining seven W.B. calls them.\nGlittereyed his rufous skull close to his greencapped desklamp sought the face bearded amid darkgreener shadow, an ollav, holyeyed. He laughed low: a sizar's laugh of Trinity: unanswered.\n\nOrchestral Satan, weeping many a rood\nTears such as angels weep.\nEd egli avea del cul fatto trombetta.\n\nHe holds my follies hostage.\n\nCranly's eleven true Wicklowmen to free their sireland. Gaptoothed Kathleen, her four beautiful green fields, the stranger in her house. And one more to hail him: ave, rabbi: the Tinahely twelve. In the shadow of the glen he cooees for them. My soul's youth I gave him, night by night. God speed. Good hunting.\n\nMulligan has my telegram.\n\nFolly. Persist.\n\n\u2014Our young Irish bards, John Eglinton censured, have yet to create a figure which the world will set beside Saxon Shakespeare's Hamlet though I admire him, as old Ben did, on this side idolatry.\n\n\u2014All these questions are purely academic, Russell oracled out of his shadow. I mean, whether Hamlet is Shakespeare or James I or Essex. Clergymen's discussions of the historicity of Jesus. Art has to reveal to us ideas, formless spiritual essences. The supreme question about a work of art is out of how deep a life does it spring. The painting of Gustave Moreau is the painting of ideas. The deepest poetry of Shelley, the words of Hamlet bring our minds into contact with the eternal wisdom, Plato's world of ideas. All the rest is the speculation of schoolboys for schoolboys.\n\nA. E. has been telling some yankee interviewer. Wall, tarnation strike me!\n\n\u2014The schoolmen were schoolboys first, Stephen said superpolitely. Aristotle was once Plato's schoolboy.\n\n\u2014And has remained so, one should hope, John Eglinton sedately said. One can see him, a model schoolboy with his diploma under his arm.\n\nHe laughed again at the now smiling bearded face.\nFormless spiritual. Father, Word and Holy Breath. Allfather, the heavenly man. Hiesos Kristos, magician of the beautiful, the Logos who suffers in us at every moment. This verily is that. I am the fire upon the altar. I am the sacrificial butter.\nDunlop, Judge, the noblest Roman of them all, A.E., Arval, the Name Ineffable, in heaven hight: K.H., their master, whose identity is no secret to adepts. Brothers of the great white lodge always watching to see if they can help. The Christ with the bridesister, moisture of light, born of an ensouled virgin, repentant sophia, departed to the plane of buddhi. The life esoteric is not for ordinary person. O.P. must work off bad karma first. Mrs Cooper Oakley once glimpsed our very illustrious sister H.P.B.'s elemental.\n\nO, fie! Out on't! Pfuiteufel! You naughtn't to look, missus, so you naughtn't when a lady's ashowing of her elemental.\n\nMr Best entered, tall, young, mild, light. He bore in his hand with grace a notebook, new, large, clean, bright.\n\n\u2014That model schoolboy, Stephen said, would find Hamlet's musings about the afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant and undramatic monologue, as shallow as Plato's.\n\nJohn Eglinton, frowning, said, waxing wroth:\n\n\u2014Upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare Aristotle with Plato.\n\n\u2014Which of the two, Stephen asked, would have banished me from his commonwealth?\nUnsheathe your dagger definitions. Horseness is the whatness of allhorse. Streams of tendency and eons they worship. God: noise in the street: very peripatetic. Space: what you damn well have to see. Through spaces smaller than red globules of man's blood they creepycrawl after Blake's buttocks into eternity of which this vegetable world is but a shadow. Hold to the now, the here, through which all future plunges to the past.\n\nMr Best came forward, amiable, towards his colleague.\n\n\u2014Haines is gone, he said.\n\n\u2014Is he?\n\n\u2014I was showing him Jubainville's book. He's quite enthusiastic, don't you know, about Hyde's Lovesongs of Connacht. I couldn't bring him in to hear the discussion. He's gone to Gill's to buy it.\nBound thee forth, my booklet, quick\nTo greet the callous public.\nWrit, I ween, 'twas not my wish\nIn lean unlovely English.\n\n\u2014The peatsmoke is going to his head, John Eglinton opined.\n\nWe feel in England. Penitent thief. Gone. I smoked his baccy. Green twinkling stone. An emerald set in the ring of the sea.\n\n\u2014People do not know how dangerous lovesongs can be, the auric egg of Russell warned occultly. The movements which work revolutions in the world are born out of the dreams and visions in a peasant's heart on the hillside. For them the earth is not an exploitable ground but the living mother. The rarefied air of the academy and the arena produce the sixshilling novel, the musichall song. France produces the finest flower of corruption in Mallarme but the desirable life is revealed only to the poor of heart, the life of Homer's Phaeacians.\n\nFrom these words Mr Best turned an unoffending face to Stephen.\n\n\u2014Mallarme, don't you know, he said, has written those wonderful prose poems Stephen MacKenna used to read to me in Paris. The one about Hamlet. He says: il se prom\u00e8ne, lisant au livre de lui-m\u00eame, don't you know, reading the book of himself. He describes Hamlet given in a French town, don't you know, a provincial town. They advertised it.\n\nHis free hand graciously wrote tiny signs in air.\n\nHAMLET\nou\nLE DISTRAIT\nPi\u00e8ce de Shakespeare\nHe repeated to John Eglinton's newgathered frown:\n\n\u2014Pi\u00e8ce de Shakespeare, don't you know. It's so French. The French point of view. Hamlet ou...\n\n\u2014The absentminded beggar, Stephen ended.\n\nJohn Eglinton laughed.\n\n\u2014Yes, I suppose it would be, he said. Excellent people, no doubt, but distressingly shortsighted in some matters.\n\nSumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder.\n\u2014A deathsman of the soul Robert Greene called him, Stephen said. Not for nothing was he a butcher's son, wielding the sledded poleaxe and spitting in his palms. Nine lives are taken off for his father's one. Our Father who art in purgatory. Khaki Hamlets don't hesitate to shoot. The bloodboltered shambles in act five is a forecast of the concentration camp sung by Mr Swinburne.\n\nCranly, I his mute orderly, following battles from afar.\n\nWhelps and dams of murderous foes whom none But we had spared...\nBetween the Saxon smile and yankee yawp. The devil and the deep sea.\n\n\u2014He will have it that Hamlet is a ghoststory, John Eglinton said for Mr Best's behoof. Like the fat boy in Pickwick he wants to make our flesh creep.\n\nList! List! O List!\n\nMy flesh hears him: creeping, hears.\n\nIf thou didst ever...\n\n\u2014What is a ghost? Stephen said with tingling energy. One who has faded into impalpability through death, through absence, through change of manners. Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Paris lies from virgin Dublin. Who is the ghost from limbo patrum, returning to the world that has forgotten him? Who is King Hamlet?\n\nJohn Eglinton shifted his spare body, leaning back to judge.\n\nLifted.\n\n\u2014It is this hour of a day in mid June, Stephen said, begging with a swift glance their hearing. The flag is up on the playhouse by the bankside. The bear Sackerson growls in the pit near it, Paris garden. Canvasclimbers who sailed with Drake chew their sausages among the groundlings.\n\nLocal colour. Work in all you know. Make them accomplices.\n\u2014Shakespeare has left the huguenot's house in Silver street and walks by the swanmews along the riverbank. But he does not stay to feed the pen chivying her game of cygnets towards the rushes. The swan of Avon has other thoughts.\n\nComposition of place. Ignatius Loyola, make haste to help me!\n\u2014The play begins. A player comes on under the shadow, made up in the castoff mail of a court buck, a wellset man with a bass voice. It is the ghost, the king, a king and no king, and the player is Shakespeare who has studied Hamlet all the years of his life which were not vanity in order to play the part of the spectre. He speaks the words to Burbage, the young player who stands before him beyond the rack of cerecloth, calling him by a name:\n\nHamlet, I am thy father's spirit,\n\nbidding him list. To a son he speaks, the son of his soul, the prince, young Hamlet and to the son of his body, Hamnet Shakespeare, who has died in Stratford that his namesake may live for ever.\n\nIs it possible that that player Shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in the vesture of buried Denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words to his own son's name (had Hamnet Shakespeare lived he would have been prince Hamlet's twin), is it possible, I want to know, or probable that he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises: you are the dispossessed son: I am the murdered father: your mother is the guilty queen, Ann Shakespeare, born Hathaway?\n\n\u2014But this prying into the family life of a great man, Russell began impatiently.\n\nArt thou there, truepenny?\n\n\u2014Interesting only to the parish clerk. I mean, we have the plays. I mean when we read the poetry of King Lear what is it to us how the poet lived? As for living our servants can do that for us, Villiers de l'Isle has said. Peeping and prying into greenroom gossip of the day, the poet's drinking, the poet's debts. We have King Lear: and it is immortal.\n\nMr Best's face, appealed to, agreed.\n\nFlow over them with your waves and with your waters, Mananaan, Mananaan MacLir...\n\nHow now, sirrah, that pound he lent you when you were hungry?\n\nMarry, I wanted it.\n\nTake thou this noble.\n\nGo to! You spent most of it in Georgina Johnson's bed, clergyman's daughter. Agenbite of inwit.\n\nDo you intend to pay it back?\n\nO, yes.\n\nWhen? Now?\n\nWell... No.\n\nWhen, then?\n\nI paid my way. I paid my way.\n\nSteady on. He's from beyant Boyne water. The northeast corner. You owe it.\n\nWait. Five months. Molecules all change. I am other I now. Other I got pound.\nBuzz. Buzz.\n\nBut I, entelechy, form of forms, am I by memory because under everchanging forms.\n\nI that sinned and prayed and fasted.\n\nA child Conmee saved from pandies.\n\nI, I and I. I.\nA.E.I.O.U.\n\n\u2014Do you mean to fly in the face of the tradition of three centuries? John Eglinton's carping voice asked. Her ghost at least has been laid for ever. She died, for literature at least, before she was born.\n\n\u2014She died, Stephen retorted, sixtyseven years after she was born. She saw him into and out of the world. She took his first embraces. She bore his children and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids closed when he lay on his deathbed.\n\nMother's deathbed. Candle. The sheeted mirror. Who brought me into this world lies there, bronzelidded, under few cheap flowers. Liliata rutilantium.\nI wept alone.\n\nJohn Eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp.\n\u2014The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake, he said, and got out of it as quickly and as best he could.\n\n\u2014Bosh! Stephen said rudely. A man of genius makes no mistakes. His errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery.\n\nPortals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian, softcreakfooted, bald, eared and assiduous.\n\n\u2014A shrew, John Eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful portal of discovery, one should imagine. What useful discovery did Socrates learn from Xanthippe?\n\n\u2014Dialectic, Stephen answered: and from his mother how to bring thoughts into the world. What he learnt from his other wife Myrto (absit nomen!), Socratididion's Epipsychidion, no man, not a woman, will ever know. But neither the midwife's lore nor the caudlelectures saved him from the archons of Sinn Fein and their naggin of hemlock.\n\n\u2014But Ann Hathaway? Mr Best's quiet voice said forgetfully. Yes, we seem to be forgetting her as Shakespeare himself forgot her.\n\nHis look went from brooder's beard to carper's skull, to remind, to chide them not unkindly, then to the baldpink lollard costard, guiltless though maligned.\n\n\u2014He had a good groatsworth of wit, Stephen said, and no truant memory. He carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to Romeville whistling The girl I left behind me. If the earthquake did not time it we should know where to place poor Wat, sitting in his form, the cry of hounds, the studded bridle and her blue windows. That memory, Venus and Adonis, lay in the bedchamber of every light-of-love in London. Is Katharine the shrew illfavoured? Hortensio calls her young and beautiful. Do you think the writer of Antony and Cleopatra, a passionate pilgrim, had his eyes in the back of his head that he chose the ugliest doxy in all Warwickshire to lie withal? Good: he left her and gained the world of men. But his boywomen are the women of a boy. Their life, thought, speech are lent them by males. He chose badly? He was chosen, it seems to me. If others have their will Ann hath a way. By cock, she was to blame. She put the comether on him, sweet and twentysix. The greyeyed goddess who bends over the boy Adonis, stooping to conquer, as prologue to the swelling act, is a boldfaced Stratford wench who tumbles in a cornfield a lover younger than herself.\nAnd my turn? When?\n\nCome!\n\n\u2014Ryefield, Mr Best said brightly, gladly, raising his new book, gladly, brightly.\n\nHe murmured then with blond delight for all:\n\nBetween the acres of the rye These pretty countryfolk would lie.\n\nParis: the wellpleased pleaser.\nA tall figure in bearded homespun rose from shadow and unveiled its cooperative watch.\n\n\u2014I am afraid I am due at the Homestead.\n\nWhither away? Exploitable ground.\n\n\u2014Are you going? John Eglinton's active eyebrows asked. Shall we see you at Moore's tonight? Piper is coming.\n\n\u2014Piper! Mr Best piped. Is Piper back?\n\nPeter Piper pecked a peck of pick of peck of pickled pepper.\n\n\u2014I don't know if I can. Thursday. We have our meeting. If I can get away in time.\n\nYogibogeybox in Dawson chambers. Isis Unveiled. Their Pali book we tried to pawn. Crosslegged under an umbrel umbershoot he thrones an Aztec logos, functioning on astral levels, their oversoul, mahamahatma. The faithful hermetists await the light, ripe for chelaship, ringroundabout him. Louis H. Victory. T. Caulfield Irwin. Lotus ladies tend them i'the eyes, their pineal glands aglow. Filled with his god, he thrones, Buddh under plantain. Gulfer of souls, engulfer. Hesouls, shesouls, shoals of souls. Engulfed with wailing creecries, whirled, whirling, they bewail.\n\nIn quintessential triviality\nFor years in this fleshcase a shesoul dwelt.\n\n\u2014They say we are to have a literary surprise, the quaker librarian said, friendly and earnest. Mr Russell, rumour has it, is gathering together a sheaf of our younger poets' verses. We are all looking forward anxiously.\n\nAnxiously he glanced in the cone of lamplight where three faces, lighted, shone.\n\nSee this. Remember.\n\nStephen looked down on a wide headless caubeen, hung on his ashplanthandle over his knee. My casque and sword. Touch lightly with two index fingers. Aristotle's experiment. One or two? Necessity is that in virtue of which it is impossible that one can be otherwise. Argal, one hat is one hat.\nListen.\n\nYoung Colum and Starkey. George Roberts is doing the commercial part. Longworth will give it a good puff in the Express. O, will he? I liked Colum's Drover. Yes, I think he has that queer thing genius. Do you think he has genius really? Yeats admired his line: As in wild earth a Grecian vase. Did he? I hope you'll be able to come tonight. Malachi Mulligan is coming too. Moore asked him to bring Haines. Did you hear Miss Mitchell's joke about Moore and Martyn? That Moore is Martyn's wild oats? Awfully clever, isn't it? They remind one of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza. Our national epic has yet to be written, Dr Sigerson says. Moore is the man for it. A knight of the rueful countenance here in Dublin. With a saffron kilt? O'Neill Russell? O, yes, he must speak the grand old tongue. And his Dulcinea? James Stephens is doing some clever sketches. We are becoming important, it seems.\nCordelia. Cordoglio. Lir's loneliest daughter.\n\nNookshotten. Now your best French polish.\n\n\u2014Thank you very much, Mr Russell, Stephen said, rising. If you will be so kind as to give the letter to Mr Norman...\n\n\u2014O, yes. If he considers it important it will go in. We have so much correspondence.\n\n\u2014I understand, Stephen said. Thanks.\n\nGod ild you. The pigs' paper. Bullockbefriending.\n\nSynge has promised me an article for Dana too. Are we going to be read? I feel we are. The Gaelic league wants something in Irish. I hope you will come round tonight. Bring Starkey.\n\nStephen sat down.\n\nThe quaker librarian came from the leavetakers. Blushing, his mask said:\n\n\u2014Mr Dedalus, your views are most illuminating.\n\nHe creaked to and fro, tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a chopine, and, covered by the noise of outgoing, said low:\n\u2014Is it your view, then, that she was not faithful to the poet?\n\nAlarmed face asks me. Why did he come? Courtesy or an inward light?\n\u2014Where there is a reconciliation, Stephen said, there must have been first a sundering.\n\n\u2014Yes.\n\nChristfox in leather trews, hiding, a runaway in blighted treeforks, from hue and cry. Knowing no vixen, walking lonely in the chase. Women he won to him, tender people, a whore of Babylon, ladies of justices, bully tapsters' wives. Fox and geese. And in New Place a slack dishonoured body that once was comely, once as sweet, as fresh as cinnamon, now her leaves falling, all, bare, frighted of the narrow grave and unforgiven.\n\u2014Yes. So you think...\n\nThe door closed behind the outgoer.\n\nRest suddenly possessed the discreet vaulted cell, rest of warm and brooding air.\n\nA vestal's lamp.\n\nHere he ponders things that were not: what Caesar would have lived to do had he believed the soothsayer: what might have been: possibilities of the possible as possible: things not known: what name Achilles bore when he lived among women.\n\nCoffined thoughts around me, in mummycases, embalmed in spice of words. Thoth, god of libraries, a birdgod, moonycrowned. And I heard the voice of that Egyptian highpriest. In painted chambers loaded with tilebooks.\nThey are still. Once quick in the brains of men. Still: but an itch of death is in them, to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale, urge me to wreak their will.\n\u2014Certainly, John Eglinton mused, of all great men he is the most enigmatic. We know nothing but that he lived and suffered. Not even so much. Others abide our question. A shadow hangs over all the rest.\n\n\u2014But Hamlet is so personal, isn't it? Mr Best pleaded. I mean, a kind of private paper, don't you know, of his private life. I mean, I don't care a button, don't you know, who is killed or who is guilty...\nHe rested an innocent book on the edge of the desk, smiling his defiance. His private papers in the original. Ta an bad ar an tir. Taim in mo shagart. Put beurla on it, littlejohn.\n\nQuoth littlejohn Eglinton:\n\n\u2014I was prepared for paradoxes from what Malachi Mulligan told us but I may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that Shakespeare is Hamlet you have a stern task before you.\nBear with me.\n\nStephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes glinting stern under wrinkled brows. A basilisk. E quando vede l'uomo l'attosca. Messer Brunetto, I thank thee for the word.\n\u2014As we, or mother Dana, weave and unweave our bodies, Stephen said, from day to day, their molecules shuttled to and fro, so does the artist weave and unweave his image. And as the mole on my right breast is where it was when I was born, though all my body has been woven of new stuff time after time, so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image of the unliving son looks forth. In the intense instant of imagination, when the mind, Shelley says, is a fading coal, that which I was is that which I am and that which in possibility I may come to be. So in the future, the sister of the past, I may see myself as I sit here now but by reflection from that which then I shall be.\n\nDrummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile.\n\n\u2014Yes, Mr Best said youngly. I feel Hamlet quite young. The bitterness might be from the father but the passages with Ophelia are surely from the son.\n\nHas the wrong sow by the lug. He is in my father. I am in his son.\n\n\u2014That mole is the last to go, Stephen said, laughing.\n\nJohn Eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow.\n\n\u2014If that were the birthmark of genius, he said, genius would be a drug in the market. The plays of Shakespeare's later years which Renan admired so much breathe another spirit.\n\n\u2014The spirit of reconciliation, the quaker librarian breathed.\n\n\u2014There can be no reconciliation, Stephen said, if there has not been a sundering.\n\nSaid that.\n\n\u2014If you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over the hell of time of King Lear, Othello, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida, look to see when and how the shadow lifts. What softens the heart of a man, shipwrecked in storms dire, Tried, like another Ulysses, Pericles, prince of Tyre?\n\nHead, redconecapped, buffeted, brineblinded.\n\n\u2014A child, a girl, placed in his arms, Marina.\n\n\u2014The leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha is a constant quantity, John Eglinton detected. The highroads are dreary but they lead to the town.\n\nGood Bacon: gone musty. Shakespeare Bacon's wild oats. Cypherjugglers going the highroads. Seekers on the great quest. What town, good masters? Mummed in names: A. E., eon: Magee, John Eglinton. East of the sun, west of the moon: Tir na n-og. Booted the twain and staved.\n\nHow many miles to Dublin? Three score and ten, sir. Will we be there by candlelight?\n\n\u2014Mr Brandes accepts it, Stephen said, as the first play of the closing period.\n\n\u2014Does he? What does Mr Sidney Lee, or Mr Simon Lazarus as some aver his name is, say of it?\n\n\u2014Marina, Stephen said, a child of storm, Miranda, a wonder, Perdita, that which was lost. What was lost is given back to him: his daughter's child. My dearest wife, Pericles says, was like this maid. Will any man love the daughter if he has not loved the mother?\n\n\u2014The art of being a grandfather, Mr Best gan murmur. l'art d'\u00eatre grand...\n\n\u2014Will he not see reborn in her, with the memory of his own youth added, another image?\n\nDo you know what you are talking about? Love, yes. Word known to all men. Amor vero aliquid alicui bonum vult unde et ea quae concupiscimus ...\n\n\u2014His own image to a man with that queer thing genius is the standard of all experience, material and moral. Such an appeal will touch him. The images of other males of his blood will repel him. He will see in them grotesque attempts of nature to foretell or to repeat himself.\n\nThe benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope.\n\n\u2014I hope Mr Dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of the public. And we ought to mention another Irish commentator, Mr George Bernard Shaw. Nor should we forget Mr Frank Harris. His articles on Shakespeare in the Saturday Review were surely brilliant. Oddly enough he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of the sonnets. The favoured rival is William Herbert, earl of Pembroke. I own that if the poet must be rejected such a rejection would seem more in harmony with\u2014what shall I say?\u2014our notions of what ought not to have been.\n\nFelicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them, auk's egg, prize of their fray.\n\nHe thous and thees her with grave husbandwords. Dost love, Miriam? Dost love thy man?\n\n\u2014That may be too, Stephen said. There's a saying of Goethe's which Mr Magee likes to quote. Beware of what you wish for in youth because you will get it in middle life. Why does he send to one who is a buonaroba, a bay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a scandalous girlhood, a lordling to woo for him? He was himself a lord of language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and he had written Romeo and Juliet. Why? Belief in himself has been untimely killed. He was overborne in a cornfield first (ryefield, I should say) and he will never be a victor in his own eyes after nor play victoriously the game of laugh and lie down. Assumed dongiovannism will not save him. No later undoing will undo the first undoing. The tusk of the boar has wounded him there where love lies ableeding. If the shrew is worsted yet there remains to her woman's invisible weapon. There is, I feel in the words, some goad of the flesh driving him into a new passion, a darker shadow of the first, darkening even his own understanding of himself. A like fate awaits him and the two rages commingle in a whirlpool.\n\nThey list. And in the porches of their ears I pour.\n\n\u2014The soul has been before stricken mortally, a poison poured in the porch of a sleeping ear. But those who are done to death in sleep cannot know the manner of their quell unless their Creator endow their souls with that knowledge in the life to come. The poisoning and the beast with two backs that urged it King Hamlet's ghost could not know of were he not endowed with knowledge by his creator. That is why the speech (his lean unlovely English) is always turned elsewhere, backward. Ravisher and ravished, what he would but would not, go with him from Lucrece's bluecircled ivory globes to Imogen's breast, bare, with its mole cinquespotted. He goes back, weary of the creation he has piled up to hide him from himself, an old dog licking an old sore. But, because loss is his gain, he passes on towards eternity in undiminished personality, untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he has revealed. His beaver is up. He is a ghost, a shadow now, the wind by Elsinore's rocks or what you will, the sea's voice, a voice heard only in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow, the son consubstantial with the father.\n\n\u2014Amen! was responded from the doorway.\n\nHast thou found me, O mine enemy?\n\nEntr'acte.\n\nA ribald face, sullen as a dean's, Buck Mulligan came forward, then blithe in motley, towards the greeting of their smiles. My telegram.\n\n\u2014You were speaking of the gaseous vertebrate, if I mistake not? he asked of Stephen.\n\nPrimrosevested he greeted gaily with his doffed Panama as with a bauble.\n\nThey make him welcome. Was Du verlachst wirst Du noch dienen.\n\nBrood of mockers: Photius, pseudomalachi, Johann Most.\n\nHe Who Himself begot middler the Holy Ghost and Himself sent Himself, Agenbuyer, between Himself and others, Who, put upon by His fiends, stripped and whipped, was nailed like bat to barndoor, starved on crosstree, Who let Him bury, stood up, harrowed hell, fared into heaven and there these nineteen hundred years sitteth on the right hand of His Own Self but yet shall come in the latter day to doom the quick and dead when all the quick shall be dead already.\nGlo\u2014o\u2014ri\u2014a in ex\u2014cel\u2014sis De\u2014o.\n\nHe lifts his hands. Veils fall. O, flowers! Bells with bells with bells aquiring.\n\n\u2014Yes, indeed, the quaker librarian said. A most instructive discussion. Mr Mulligan, I'll be bound, has his theory too of the play and of Shakespeare. All sides of life should be represented.\n\nHe smiled on all sides equally.\n\nBuck Mulligan thought, puzzled:\n\n\u2014Shakespeare? he said. I seem to know the name.\n\nA flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features.\n\n\u2014To be sure, he said, remembering brightly. The chap that writes like Synge.\n\nMr Best turned to him.\n\n\u2014Haines missed you, he said. Did you meet him? He'll see you after at the D. B. C. He's gone to Gill's to buy Hyde's Lovesongs of Connacht.\n\n\u2014I came through the museum, Buck Mulligan said. Was he here?\n\n\u2014The bard's fellowcountrymen, John Eglinton answered, are rather tired perhaps of our brilliancies of theorising. I hear that an actress played Hamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in Dublin. Vining held that the prince was a woman. Has no-one made him out to be an Irishman? Judge Barton, I believe, is searching for some clues. He swears (His Highness not His Lordship) by saint Patrick.\n\n\u2014The most brilliant of all is that story of Wilde's, Mr Best said, lifting his brilliant notebook. That Portrait of Mr W. H. where he proves that the sonnets were written by a Willie Hughes, a man all hues.\n\n\u2014For Willie Hughes, is it not? the quaker librarian asked.\n\nOr Hughie Wills? Mr William Himself. W. H.: who am I?\n\n\u2014I mean, for Willie Hughes, Mr Best said, amending his gloss easily. Of course it's all paradox, don't you know, Hughes and hews and hues, the colour, but it's so typical the way he works it out. It's the very essence of Wilde, don't you know. The light touch.\n\nHis glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled, a blond ephebe. Tame essence of Wilde.\n\nYou're darned witty. Three drams of usquebaugh you drank with Dan Deasy's ducats.\n\nHow much did I spend? O, a few shillings.\n\nFor a plump of pressmen. Humour wet and dry.\n\nWit. You would give your five wits for youth's proud livery he pranks in. Lineaments of gratified desire.\n\nThere be many mo. Take her for me. In pairing time. Jove, a cool ruttime send them. Yea, turtledove her.\n\nEve. Naked wheatbellied sin. A snake coils her, fang in's kiss.\n\n\u2014Do you think it is only a paradox? the quaker librarian was asking. The mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious.\n\nThey talked seriously of mocker's seriousness.\n\nBuck Mulligan's again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile. Then, his head wagging, he came near, drew a folded telegram from his pocket. His mobile lips read, smiling with new delight.\n\n\u2014Telegram! he said. Wonderful inspiration! Telegram! A papal bull!\n\nHe sat on a corner of the unlit desk, reading aloud joyfully:\n\n\u2014The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done. Signed: Dedalus. Where did you launch it from? The kips? No. College Green. Have you drunk the four quid? The aunt is going to call on your unsubstantial father. Telegram! Malachi Mulligan, The Ship, lower Abbey street. O, you peerless mummer! O, you priestified Kinchite!\n\nJoyfully he thrust message and envelope into a pocket but keened in a querulous brogue:\n\n\u2014It's what I'm telling you, mister honey, it's queer and sick we were, Haines and myself, the time himself brought it in. 'Twas murmur we did for a gallus potion would rouse a friar, I'm thinking, and he limp with leching. And we one hour and two hours and three hours in Connery's sitting civil waiting for pints apiece.\n\nHe wailed:\n\n\u2014And we to be there, mavrone, and you to be unbeknownst sending us your conglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a yard long like the drouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful.\n\nStephen laughed.\n\nQuickly, warningfully Buck Mulligan bent down.\n\n\u2014The tramper Synge is looking for you, he said, to murder you. He heard you pissed on his halldoor in Glasthule. He's out in pampooties to murder you.\n\n\u2014Me! Stephen exclaimed. That was your contribution to literature.\n\nBuck Mulligan gleefully bent back, laughing to the dark eavesdropping ceiling.\n\n\u2014Murder you! he laughed.\n\nHarsh gargoyle face that warred against me over our mess of hash of lights in rue Saint-Andr\u00e9-des-Arts. In words of words for words, palabras. Oisin with Patrick. Faunman he met in Clamart woods, brandishing a winebottle. C'est vendredi saint! Murthering Irish. His image, wandering, he met. I mine. I met a fool i'the forest.\n\n\u2014Mr Lyster, an attendant said from the door ajar.\n\n\u2014... in which everyone can find his own. So Mr Justice Madden in his Diary of Master William Silence has found the hunting terms... Yes? What is it?\n\n\u2014There's a gentleman here, sir, the attendant said, coming forward and offering a card. From the Freeman. He wants to see the files of the Kilkenny People for last year.\n\n\u2014Certainly, certainly, certainly. Is the gentleman?...\n\nHe took the eager card, glanced, not saw, laid down unglanced, looked, asked, creaked, asked:\n\n\u2014Is he?... O, there!\n\nBrisk in a galliard he was off, out. In the daylit corridor he talked with voluble pains of zeal, in duty bound, most fair, most kind, most honest broadbrim.\n\n\u2014This gentleman? Freeman's Journal? Kilkenny People? To be sure. Good day, sir. Kilkenny... We have certainly...\n\nA patient silhouette waited, listening.\n\n\u2014All the leading provincial... Northern Whig, Cork Examiner, Enniscorthy Guardian, 1903... Will you please?... Evans, conduct this gentleman... If you just follow the atten... Or, please allow me... This way... Please, sir...\n\nVoluble, dutiful, he led the way to all the provincial papers, a bowing dark figure following his hasty heels.\n\nThe door closed.\n\n\u2014The sheeny! Buck Mulligan cried.\n\nHe jumped up and snatched the card.\n\n\u2014What's his name? Ikey Moses? Bloom.\n\nHe rattled on:\n\n\u2014Jehovah, collector of prepuces, is no more. I found him over in the museum where I went to hail the foamborn Aphrodite. The Greek mouth that has never been twisted in prayer. Every day we must do homage to her. Life of life, thy lips enkindle.\n\nSuddenly he turned to Stephen:\n\n\u2014He knows you. He knows your old fellow. O, I fear me, he is Greeker than the Greeks. His pale Galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove. Venus Kallipyge. O, the thunder of those loins! The god pursuing the maiden hid.\n\n\u2014We want to hear more, John Eglinton decided with Mr Best's approval. We begin to be interested in Mrs S. Till now we had thought of her, if at all, as a patient Griselda, a Penelope stayathome.\n\n\u2014Antisthenes, pupil of Gorgias, Stephen said, took the palm of beauty from Kyrios Menelaus' brooddam, Argive Helen, the wooden mare of Troy in whom a score of heroes slept, and handed it to poor Penelope. Twenty years he lived in London and, during part of that time, he drew a salary equal to that of the lord chancellor of Ireland. His life was rich. His art, more than the art of feudalism as Walt Whitman called it, is the art of surfeit. Hot herringpies, green mugs of sack, honeysauces, sugar of roses, marchpane, gooseberried pigeons, ringocandies. Sir Walter Raleigh, when they arrested him, had half a million francs on his back including a pair of fancy stays. The gombeenwoman Eliza Tudor had underlinen enough to vie with her of Sheba. Twenty years he dallied there between conjugial love and its chaste delights and scortatory love and its foul pleasures. You know Manningham's story of the burgher's wife who bade Dick Burbage to her bed after she had seen him in Richard III and how Shakespeare, overhearing, without more ado about nothing, took the cow by the horns and, when Burbage came knocking at the gate, answered from the capon's blankets: William the conqueror came before Richard III. And the gay lakin, mistress Fitton, mount and cry O, and his dainty birdsnies, lady Penelope Rich, a clean quality woman is suited for a player, and the punks of the bankside, a penny a time.\n\nCours la Reine. Encore vingt sous. Nous ferons de petites cochonneries. Minette? Tu veux?\n\n\u2014The height of fine society. And sir William Davenant of oxford's mother with her cup of canary for any cockcanary.\n\nBuck Mulligan, his pious eyes upturned, prayed:\n\n\u2014Blessed Margaret Mary Anycock!\n\n\u2014And Harry of six wives' daughter. And other lady friends from neighbour seats as Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet, sings. But all those twenty years what do you suppose poor Penelope in Stratford was doing behind the diamond panes?\n\nDo and do. Thing done. In a rosery of Fetter lane of Gerard, herbalist, he walks, greyedauburn. An azured harebell like her veins. Lids of Juno's eyes, violets. He walks. One life is all. One body. Do. But do. Afar, in a reek of lust and squalor, hands are laid on whiteness.\n\nBuck Mulligan rapped John Eglinton's desk sharply.\n\n\u2014Whom do you suspect? he challenged.\n\n\u2014Say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets. Once spurned twice spurned. But the court wanton spurned him for a lord, his dearmylove.\n\nLove that dare not speak its name.\n\n\u2014As an Englishman, you mean, John sturdy Eglinton put in, he loved a lord.\n\nOld wall where sudden lizards flash. At Charenton I watched them.\n\n\u2014It seems so, Stephen said, when he wants to do for him, and for all other and singular uneared wombs, the holy office an ostler does for the stallion. Maybe, like Socrates, he had a midwife to mother as he had a shrew to wife. But she, the giglot wanton, did not break a bedvow. Two deeds are rank in that ghost's mind: a broken vow and the dullbrained yokel on whom her favour has declined, deceased husband's brother. Sweet Ann, I take it, was hot in the blood. Once a wooer, twice a wooer.\n\nStephen turned boldly in his chair.\n\n\u2014The burden of proof is with you not with me, he said frowning. If you deny that in the fifth scene of Hamlet he has branded her with infamy tell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years between the day she married him and the day she buried him. All those women saw their men down and under: Mary, her goodman John, Ann, her poor dear Willun, when he went and died on her, raging that he was the first to go, Joan, her four brothers, Judith, her husband and all her sons, Susan, her husband too, while Susan's daughter, Elizabeth, to use granddaddy's words, wed her second, having killed her first.\n\nO, yes, mention there is. In the years when he was living richly in royal London to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her father's shepherd. Explain you then. Explain the swansong too wherein he has commended her to posterity.\n\nHe faced their silence.\n\nTo whom thus Eglinton:\nYou mean the will.\nBut that has been explained, I believe, by jurists.\nShe was entitled to her widow's dower\nAt common law. His legal knowledge was great\nOur judges tell us.\nHim Satan fleers,\nMocker:\nAnd therefore he left out her name\nFrom the first draft but he did not leave out\nThe presents for his granddaughter, for his daughters,\nFor his sister, for his old cronies in Stratford\nAnd in London. And therefore when he was urged,\nAs I believe, to name her\nHe left her his\nSecondbest\nBed.\nPunkt.\nLeftherhis\nSecondbest\nLeftherhis\nBestabed\nSecabest\nLeftabed.\n\nWoa!\n\n\u2014Pretty countryfolk had few chattels then, John Eglinton observed, as they have still if our peasant plays are true to type.\n\n\u2014He was a rich country gentleman, Stephen said, with a coat of arms and landed estate at Stratford and a house in Ireland yard, a capitalist shareholder, a bill promoter, a tithefarmer. Why did he not leave her his best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in peace?\n\n\u2014It is clear that there were two beds, a best and a secondbest, Mr Secondbest Best said finely.\n\n\u2014Separatio a mensa et a thalamo, bettered Buck Mulligan and was smiled on.\n\n\u2014Antiquity mentions famous beds, Second Eglinton puckered, bedsmiling. Let me think.\n\n\u2014Antiquity mentions that Stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen sage, Stephen said, who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves, pays tribute to his elders, wills to be laid in earth near the bones of his dead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress (don't forget Nell Gwynn Herpyllis) and let her live in his villa.\n\n\u2014Do you mean he died so? Mr Best asked with slight concern. I mean...\n\n\u2014He died dead drunk, Buck Mulligan capped. A quart of ale is a dish for a king. O, I must tell you what Dowden said!\n\n\u2014What? asked Besteglinton.\n\nWilliam Shakespeare and company, limited. The people's William. For terms apply: E. Dowden, Highfield house...\n\n\u2014Lovely! Buck Mulligan suspired amorously. I asked him what he thought of the charge of pederasty brought against the bard. He lifted his hands and said: All we can say is that life ran very high in those days. Lovely!\n\nCatamite.\n\n\u2014The sense of beauty leads us astray, said beautifulinsadness Best to ugling Eglinton.\n\nSteadfast John replied severe:\n\n\u2014The doctor can tell us what those words mean. You cannot eat your cake and have it.\n\nSayest thou so? Will they wrest from us, from me, the palm of beauty?\n\n\u2014And the sense of property, Stephen said. He drew Shylock out of his own long pocket. The son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was himself a cornjobber and moneylender, with ten tods of corn hoarded in the famine riots. His borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship mentioned by Chettle Falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing. He sued a fellowplayer for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted his pound of flesh in interest for every money lent. How else could Aubrey's ostler and callboy get rich quick? All events brought grist to his mill. Shylock chimes with the jewbaiting that followed the hanging and quartering of the queen's leech Lopez, his jew's heart being plucked forth while the sheeny was yet alive: Hamlet and Macbeth with the coming to the throne of a Scotch philosophaster with a turn for witchroasting. The lost armada is his jeer in Love's Labour Lost. His pageants, the histories, sail fullbellied on a tide of Mafeking enthusiasm. Warwickshire jesuits are tried and we have a porter's theory of equivocation. The Sea Venture comes home from Bermudas and the play Renan admired is written with Patsy Caliban, our American cousin. The sugared sonnets follow Sidney's. As for fay Elizabeth, otherwise carrotty Bess, the gross virgin who inspired The Merry Wives of Windsor, let some meinherr from Almany grope his life long for deephid meanings in the depths of the buckbasket.\n\nI think you're getting on very nicely. Just mix up a mixture of theolologicophilolological. Mingo, minxi, mictum, mingere.\n\n\u2014Prove that he was a jew, John Eglinton dared,'expectantly. Your dean of studies holds he was a holy Roman.\n\nSufflaminandus sum.\n\n\u2014He was made in Germany, Stephen replied, as the champion French polisher of Italian scandals.\n\n\u2014A myriadminded man, Mr Best reminded. Coleridge called him myriadminded.\nAmplius. In societate humana hoc est maxime necessarium ut sit amicitia inter multos.\n\n\u2014Saint Thomas, Stephen began...\n\n\u2014Ora pro nobis, Monk Mulligan groaned, sinking to a chair.\n\nThere he keened a wailing rune.\n\n\u2014Pogue mahone! Acushla machree! It's destroyed we are from this day! It's destroyed we are surely!\n\nAll smiled their smiles.\n\n\u2014Saint Thomas, Stephen smiling said, whose gorbellied works I enjoy reading in the original, writing of incest from a standpoint different from that of the new Viennese school Mr Magee spoke of, likens it in his wise and curious way to an avarice of the emotions. He means that the love so given to one near in blood is covetously withheld from some stranger who, it may be, hungers for it. Jews, whom christians tax with avarice, are of all races the most given to intermarriage. Accusations are made in anger. The christian laws which built up the hoards of the jews (for whom, as for the lollards, storm was shelter) bound their affections too with hoops of steel. Whether these be sins or virtues old Nobodaddy will tell us at doomsday leet. But a man who holds so tightly to what he calls his rights over what he calls his debts will hold tightly also to what he calls his rights over her whom he calls his wife. No sir smile neighbour shall covet his ox or his wife or his manservant or his maidservant or his jackass.\n\n\u2014Or his jennyass, Buck Mulligan antiphoned.\n\n\u2014Gentle Will is being roughly handled, gentle Mr Best said gently.\n\n\u2014Which will? gagged sweetly Buck Mulligan. We are getting mixed.\n\n\u2014The will to live, John Eglinton philosophised, for poor Ann, Will's widow, is the will to die.\n\n\u2014Requiescat! Stephen prayed.\n\nWhat of all the will to do?\nIt has vanished long ago...\n\n\u2014She lies laid out in stark stiffness in that secondbest bed, the mobled queen, even though you prove that a bed in those days was as rare as a motorcar is now and that its carvings were the wonder of seven parishes. In old age she takes up with gospellers (one stayed with her at New Place and drank a quart of sack the town council paid for but in which bed he slept it skills not to ask) and heard she had a soul. She read or had read to her his chapbooks preferring them to the Merry Wives and, loosing her nightly waters on the jordan, she thought over Hooks and Eyes for Believers' Breeches and The most Spiritual Snuffbox to Make the Most Devout Souls Sneeze. Venus has twisted her lips in prayer. Agenbite of inwit: remorse of conscience. It is an age of exhausted whoredom groping for its god.\n\n\u2014History shows that to be true, inquit Eglintonus Chronolologos. The ages succeed one another. But we have it on high authority that a man's worst enemies shall be those of his own house and family. I feel that Russell is right. What do we care for his wife or father? I should say that only family poets have family lives. Falstaff was not a family man. I feel that the fat knight is his supreme creation.\n\nLean, he lay back. Shy, deny thy kindred, the unco guid. Shy, supping with the godless, he sneaks the cup. A sire in Ultonian Antrim bade it him. Visits him here on quarter days. Mr Magee, sir, there's a gentleman to see you. Me? Says he's your father, sir. Give me my Wordsworth. Enter Magee Mor Matthew, a rugged rough rugheaded kern, in strossers with a buttoned codpiece, his nether stocks bemired with clauber of ten forests, a wand of wilding in his hand.\nYour own? He knows your old fellow. The widower.\n\nHurrying to her squalid deathlair from gay Paris on the quayside I touched his hand. The voice, new warmth, speaking. Dr Bob Kenny is attending her. The eyes that wish me well. But do not know me.\n\u2014A father, Stephen said, battling against hopelessness, is a necessary evil. He wrote the play in the months that followed his father's death. If you hold that he, a greying man with two marriageable daughters, with thirtyfive years of life, nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita, with fifty of experience, is the beardless undergraduate from Wittenberg then you must hold that his seventyyear old mother is the lustful queen. No. The corpse of John Shakespeare does not walk the night. From hour to hour it rots and rots. He rests, disarmed of fatherhood, having devised that mystical estate upon his son. Boccaccio's Calandrino was the first and last man who felt himself with child. Fatherhood, in the sense of conscious begetting, is unknown to man. It is a mystical estate, an apostolic succession, from only begetter to only begotten. On that mystery and not on the madonna which the cunning Italian intellect flung to the mob of Europe the church is founded and founded irremovably because founded, like the world, macro and microcosm, upon the void. Upon incertitude, upon unlikelihood. Amor matris, subjective and objective genitive, may be the only true thing in life. Paternity may be a legal fiction. Who is the father of any son that any son should love him or he any son?\n\nWhat the hell are you driving at?\n\nI know. Shut up. Blast you. I have reasons.\n\nAmplius. Adhuc. Iterum. Postea.\n\nAre you condemned to do this?\n\n\u2014They are sundered by a bodily shame so steadfast that the criminal annals of the world, stained with all other incests and bestialities, hardly record its breach. Sons with mothers, sires with daughters, lesbic sisters, loves that dare not speak their name, nephews with grandmothers, jailbirds with keyholes, queens with prize bulls. The son unborn mars beauty: born, he brings pain, divides affection, increases care. He is a new male: his growth is his father's decline, his youth his father's envy, his friend his father's enemy.\n\nIn rue Monsieur-le-Prince I thought it.\n\n\u2014What links them in nature? An instant of blind rut.\n\nAm I a father? If I were?\n\nShrunken uncertain hand.\n\n\u2014Sabellius, the African, subtlest heresiarch of all the beasts of the field, held that the Father was Himself His Own Son. The bulldog of Aquin, with whom no word shall be impossible, refutes him. Well: if the father who has not a son be not a father can the son who has not a father be a son? When Rutlandbaconsouthamptonshakespeare or another poet of the same name in the comedy of errors wrote Hamlet he was not the father of his own son merely but, being no more a son, he was and felt himself the father of all his race, the father of his own grandfather, the father of his unborn grandson who, by the same token, never was born, for nature, as Mr Magee understands her, abhors perfection.\n\nEglintoneyes, quick with pleasure, looked up shybrightly. Gladly glancing, a merry puritan, through the twisted eglantine.\n\nFlatter. Rarely. But flatter.\n\n\u2014Himself his own father, Sonmulligan told himself. Wait. I am big with child. I have an unborn child in my brain. Pallas Athena! A play! The play's the thing! Let me parturiate!\n\nHe clasped his paunchbrow with both birthaiding hands.\n\n\u2014As for his family, Stephen said, his mother's name lives in the forest of Arden. Her death brought from him the scene with Volumnia in Coriolanus. His boyson's death is the deathscene of young Arthur in King John. Hamlet, the black prince, is Hamnet Shakespeare. Who the girls in The Tempest, in Pericles, in Winter's Tale are we know. Who Cleopatra, fleshpot of Egypt, and Cressid and Venus are we may guess. But there is another member of his family who is recorded.\n\n\u2014The plot thickens, John Eglinton said.\n\nThe quaker librarian, quaking, tiptoed in, quake, his mask, quake, with haste, quake, quack.\n\nDoor closed. Cell. Day.\n\nThey list. Three. They.\n\nI you he they.\n\nCome, mess.\n\nSTEPHEN: He had three brothers, Gilbert, Edmund, Richard. Gilbert in his old age told some cavaliers he got a pass for nowt from Maister Gatherer one time mass he did and he seen his brud Maister Wull the playwriter up in Lunnon in a wrastling play wud a man on's back. The playhouse sausage filled Gilbert's soul. He is nowhere: but an Edmund and a Richard are recorded in the works of sweet William.\n\nMAGEEGLINJOHN: Names! What's in a name?\n\nBEST: That is my name, Richard, don't you know. I hope you are going to say a good word for Richard, don't you know, for my sake. (Laughter)\n\nBUCKMULLIGAN: (Piano, diminuendo)\n\nThen outspoke medical Dick\nTo his comrade medical Davy...\n\nSTEPHEN: In his trinity of black Wills, the villain shakebags, Iago, Richard Crookback, Edmund in King Lear, two bear the wicked uncles' names. Nay, that last play was written or being written while his brother Edmund lay dying in Southwark.\n\nBEST: I hope Edmund is going to catch it. I don't want Richard, my name ...\n\n(Laughter)\n\nQUAKERLYSTER: (A tempo) But he that filches from me my good name...\n\nSTEPHEN: (Stringendo) He has hidden his own name, a fair name, William, in the plays, a super here, a clown there, as a painter of old Italy set his face in a dark corner of his canvas. He has revealed it in the sonnets where there is Will in overplus. Like John o'Gaunt his name is dear to him, as dear as the coat and crest he toadied for, on a bend sable a spear or steeled argent, honorificabilitudinitatibus, dearer than his glory of greatest shakescene in the country. What's in a name? That is what we ask ourselves in childhood when we write the name that we are told is ours. A star, a daystar, a firedrake, rose at his birth. It shone by day in the heavens alone, brighter than Venus in the night, and by night it shone over delta in Cassiopeia, the recumbent constellation which is the signature of his initial among the stars. His eyes watched it, lowlying on the horizon, eastward of the bear, as he walked by the slumberous summer fields at midnight returning from Shottery and from her arms.\n\nBoth satisfied. I too.\n\nDon't tell them he was nine years old when it was quenched.\n\nAnd from her arms.\n\nWait to be wooed and won. Ay, meacock. Who will woo you?\n\nRead the skies. Autontimorumenos. Bous Stephanoumenos. Where's your configuration? Stephen, Stephen, cut the bread even. S. D: sua donna. Gi\u00e0: di lui. gelindo risolve di non amare S. D.\n\n\u2014What is that, Mr Dedalus? the quaker librarian asked. Was it a celestial phenomenon?\n\n\u2014A star by night, Stephen said. A pillar of the cloud by day.\n\nWhat more's to speak?\n\nStephen looked on his hat, his stick, his boots.\n\nStephanos, my crown. My sword. His boots are spoiling the shape of my feet. Buy a pair. Holes in my socks. Handkerchief too.\n\n\u2014You make good use of the name, John Eglinton allowed. Your own name is strange enough. I suppose it explains your fantastical humour.\n\nMe, Magee and Mulligan.\n\nFabulous artificer. The hawklike man. You flew. Whereto? Newhaven-Dieppe, steerage passenger. Paris and back. Lapwing. Icarus. Pater, ait. Seabedabbled, fallen, weltering. Lapwing you are. Lapwing be.\n\nMr Best eagerquietly lifted his book to say:\n\n\u2014That's very interesting because that brother motive, don't you know, we find also in the old Irish myths. Just what you say. The three brothers Shakespeare. In Grimm too, don't you know, the fairytales. The third brother that always marries the sleeping beauty and wins the best prize.\n\nBest of Best brothers. Good, better, best.\n\nThe quaker librarian springhalted near.\n\n\u2014I should like to know, he said, which brother you... I understand you to suggest there was misconduct with one of the brothers... But perhaps I am anticipating?\n\nHe caught himself in the act: looked at all: refrained.\n\nAn attendant from the doorway called:\n\n\u2014Mr Lyster! Father Dineen wants...\n\n\u2014O, Father Dineen! Directly.\n\nSwiftly rectly creaking rectly rectly he was rectly gone.\n\nJohn Eglinton touched the foil.\n\n\u2014Come, he said. Let us hear what you have to say of Richard and Edmund. You kept them for the last, didn't you?\n\n\u2014In asking you to remember those two noble kinsmen nuncle Richie and nuncle Edmund, Stephen answered, I feel I am asking too much perhaps. A brother is as easily forgotten as an umbrella.\n\nLapwing.\n\nWhere is your brother? Apothecaries' hall. My whetstone. Him, then Cranly, Mulligan: now these. Speech, speech. But act. Act speech. They mock to try you. Act. Be acted on.\n\nLapwing.\n\nI am tired of my voice, the voice of Esau. My kingdom for a drink.\n\nOn.\n\n\u2014You will say those names were already in the chronicles from which he took the stuff of his plays. Why did he take them rather than others? Richard, a whoreson crookback, misbegotten, makes love to a widowed Ann (what's in a name?), woos and wins her, a whoreson merry widow. Richard the conqueror, third brother, came after William the conquered. The other four acts of that play hang limply from that first. Of all his kings Richard is the only king unshielded by Shakespeare's reverence, the angel of the world. Why is the underplot of King Lear in which Edmund figures lifted out of Sidney's Arcadia and spatchcocked on to a Celtic legend older than history?\n\n\u2014That was Will's way, John Eglinton defended. We should not now combine a Norse saga with an excerpt from a novel by George Meredith. Que voulez-vous? Moore would say. He puts Bohemia on the seacoast and makes Ulysses quote Aristotle.\n\n\u2014Why? Stephen answered himself. Because the theme of the false or the usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to Shakespeare, what the poor are not, always with him. The note of banishment, banishment from the heart, banishment from home, sounds uninterruptedly from The Two Gentlemen of Verona onward till Prospero breaks his staff, buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his book. It doubles itself in the middle of his life, reflects itself in another, repeats itself, protasis, epitasis, catastasis, catastrophe. It repeats itself again when he is near the grave, when his married daughter Susan, chip of the old block, is accused of adultery. But it was the original sin that darkened his understanding, weakened his will and left in him a strong inclination to evil. The words are those of my lords bishops of Maynooth. An original sin and, like original sin, committed by another in whose sin he too has sinned. It is between the lines of his last written words, it is petrified on his tombstone under which her four bones are not to be laid. Age has not withered it. Beauty and peace have not done it away. It is in infinite variety everywhere in the world he has created, in Much Ado about Nothing, twice in As you like It, in The Tempest, in Hamlet, in Measure for Measure\u2014and in all the other plays which I have not read.\n\nHe laughed to free his mind from his mind's bondage.\n\nJudge Eglinton summed up.\n\n\u2014The truth is midway, he affirmed. He is the ghost and the prince. He is all in all.\n\n\u2014He is, Stephen said. The boy of act one is the mature man of act five. All in all. In Cymbeline, in Othello he is bawd and cuckold. He acts and is acted on. Lover of an ideal or a perversion, like Jose he kills the real Carmen. His unremitting intellect is the hornmad Iago ceaselessly willing that the moor in him shall suffer.\n\n\u2014Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuck Mulligan clucked lewdly. O word of fear!\nDark dome received, reverbed.\n\n\u2014And what a character is Iago! undaunted John Eglinton exclaimed. When all is said Dumas fils (or is it Dumas p\u00e8re?) is right. After God Shakespeare has created most.\n\n\u2014Man delights him not nor woman neither, Stephen said. He returns after a life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born, where he has always been, man and boy, a silent witness and there, his journey of life ended, he plants his mulberrytree in the earth. Then dies. The motion is ended. Gravediggers bury Hamlet (p\u00e8re?) and Hamlet fils. A king and a prince at last in death, with incidental music. And, what though murdered and betrayed, bewept by all frail tender hearts for, Dane or Dubliner, sorrow for the dead is the only husband from whom they refuse to be divorced. If you like the epilogue look long on it: prosperous Prospero, the good man rewarded, Lizzie, grandpa's lump of love, and nuncle Richie, the bad man taken off by poetic justice to the place where the bad niggers go. Strong curtain. He found in the world without as actual what was in his world within as possible. Maeterlinck says: If Socrates leave his house today he will find the sage seated on his doorstep. If Judas go forth tonight it is to Judas his steps will tend. Every life is many days, day after day. We walk through ourselves, meeting robbers, ghosts, giants, old men, young men, wives, widows, brothers-in-love, but always meeting ourselves. The playwright who wrote the folio of this world and wrote it badly (He gave us light first and the sun two days later), the lord of things as they are whom the most Roman of catholics call dio boia, hangman god, is doubtless all in all in all of us, ostler and butcher, and would be bawd and cuckold too but that in the economy of heaven, foretold by Hamlet, there are no more marriages, glorified man, an androgynous angel, being a wife unto himself.\n\n\u2014Eureka! Buck Mulligan cried. Eureka!\n\nSuddenly happied he jumped up and reached in a stride John Eglinton's desk.\n\n\u2014May I? he said. The Lord has spoken to Malachi.\n\nHe began to scribble on a slip of paper.\n\nTake some slips from the counter going out.\n\n\u2014Those who are married, Mr Best, douce herald, said, all save one, shall live. The rest shall keep as they are.\n\nHe laughed, unmarried, at Eglinton Johannes, of arts a bachelor.\n\nUnwed, unfancied, ware of wiles, they fingerponder nightly each his variorum edition of The Taming of the Shrew.\n\n\u2014You are a delusion, said roundly John Eglinton to Stephen. You have brought us all this way to show us a French triangle. Do you believe your own theory?\n\n\u2014No, Stephen said promptly.\n\n\u2014Are you going to write it? Mr Best asked. You ought to make it a dialogue, don't you know, like the Platonic dialogues Wilde wrote.\n\nJohn Eclecticon doubly smiled.\n\n\u2014Well, in that case, he said, I don't see why you should expect payment for it since you don't believe it yourself. Dowden believes there is some mystery in Hamlet but will say no more. Herr Bleibtreu, the man Piper met in Berlin, who is working up that Rutland theory, believes that the secret is hidden in the Stratford monument. He is going to visit the present duke, Piper says, and prove to him that his ancestor wrote the plays. It will come as a surprise to his grace. But he believes his theory.\n\nI believe, O Lord, help my unbelief. That is, help me to believe or help me to unbelieve? Who helps to believe? Egomen. Who to unbelieve? Other chap.\n\n\u2014You are the only contributor to Dana who asks for pieces of silver. Then I don't know about the next number. Fred Ryan wants space for an article on economics.\nFraidrine. Two pieces of silver he lent me. Tide you over. Economics.\n\n\u2014For a guinea, Stephen said, you can publish this interview.\n\nBuck Mulligan stood up from his laughing scribbling, laughing: and then gravely said, honeying malice:\n\n\u2014I called upon the bard Kinch at his summer residence in upper Mecklenburgh street and found him deep in the study of the Summa contra Gentiles in the company of two gonorrheal ladies, Fresh Nelly and Rosalie, the coalquay whore.\n\nHe broke away.\n\n\u2014Come, Kinch. Come, wandering Aengus of the birds.\n\nCome, Kinch. You have eaten all we left. Ay. I will serve you your orts and offals.\n\nStephen rose.\n\nLife is many days. This will end.\n\n\u2014We shall see you tonight, John Eglinton said. Notre ami Moore says Malachi Mulligan must be there.\n\nBuck Mulligan flaunted his slip and panama.\n\n\u2014Monsieur Moore, he said, lecturer on French letters to the youth of Ireland. I'll be there. Come, Kinch, the bards must drink. Can you walk straight?\n\nLaughing, he...\n\nSwill till eleven. Irish nights entertainment.\n\nLubber...\n\nStephen followed a lubber...\n\nOne day in the national library we had a discussion. Shakes. After. His lub back: I followed. I gall his kibe.\n\nStephen, greeting, then all amort, followed a lubber jester, a wellkempt head, newbarbered, out of the vaulted cell into a shattering daylight of no thought.\n\nWhat have I learned? Of them? Of me?\n\nWalk like Haines now.\n\nThe constant readers' room. In the readers' book Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell parafes his polysyllables. Item: was Hamlet mad? The quaker's pate godlily with a priesteen in booktalk.\n\n\u2014O please do, sir... I shall be most pleased...\n\nAmused Buck Mulligan mused in pleasant murmur with himself, selfnodding:\n\n\u2014A pleased bottom.\n\nThe turnstile.\n\nIs that?... Blueribboned hat... Idly writing... What? Looked?...\n\nThe curving balustrade: smoothsliding Mincius.\n\nPuck Mulligan, panamahelmeted, went step by step, iambing, trolling:\n\nJohn Eglinton, my jo, John, Why won't you wed a wife?\n\nHe spluttered to the air:\n\n\u2014O, the chinless Chinaman! Chin Chon Eg Lin Ton. We went over to their playbox, Haines and I, the plumbers' hall. Our players are creating a new art for Europe like the Greeks or M. Maeterlinck. Abbey Theatre! I smell the pubic sweat of monks.\n\nHe spat blank.\n\nForgot: any more than he forgot the whipping lousy Lucy gave him. And left the femme de trente ans. And why no other children born? And his first child a girl?\n\nAfterwit. Go back.\n\nThe dour recluse still there (he has his cake) and the douce youngling, minion of pleasure, Phedo's toyable fair hair.\n\nEh... I just eh... wanted... I forgot... he...\n\n\u2014Longworth and M'Curdy Atkinson were there...\n\nPuck Mulligan footed featly, trilling:\n\nI hardly hear the purlieu cry\nOr a tommy talk as I pass one by\nBefore my thoughts begin to run\nOn F. M'Curdy Atkinson,\nThe same that had the wooden leg\nAnd that filibustering filibeg\nThat never dared to slake his drouth,\nMagee that had the chinless mouth.\nBeing afraid to marry on earth\nThey masturbated for all they were worth.\n\nJest on. Know thyself.\n\nHalted, below me, a quizzer looks at me. I halt.\n\n\u2014Mournful mummer, Buck Mulligan moaned. Synge has left off wearing black to be like nature. Only crows, priests and English coal are black.\n\nA laugh tripped over his lips.\n\n\u2014Longworth is awfully sick, he said, after what you wrote about that old hake Gregory. O you inquisitional drunken jewjesuit! She gets you a job on the paper and then you go and slate her drivel to Jaysus. Couldn't you do the Yeats touch?\n\nHe went on and down, mopping, chanting with waving graceful arms:\n\n\u2014The most beautiful book that has come out of our country in my time. One thinks of Homer.\n\nHe stopped at the stairfoot.\n\n\u2014I have conceived a play for the mummers, he said solemnly.\n\nThe pillared Moorish hall, shadows entwined. Gone the nine men's morrice with caps of indices.\n\nIn sweetly varying voices Buck Mulligan read his tablet: Everyman His own Wife or A Honeymoon in the Hand (a national immorality in three orgasms) by Ballocky Mulligan.\n\nHe turned a happy patch's smirk to Stephen, saying:\n\n\u2014The disguise, I fear, is thin. But listen.\n\nHe read, marcato:\n\n\u2014Characters:\n\nTODY TOSTOFF (a ruined Pole)\nCRAB (a bushranger)\nMEDICAL DICK )\nand ) (two birds with one stone)\nMEDICAL DAVY )\nMOTHER GROGAN (a watercarrier)\nFRESH NELLY\nand\nROSALIE (the coalquay whore).\n\nHe laughed, lolling a to and fro head, walking on, followed by Stephen: and mirthfully he told the shadows, souls of men:\n\n\u2014O, the night in the Camden hall when the daughters of Erin had to lift their skirts to step over you as you lay in your mulberrycoloured, multicoloured, multitudinous vomit!\n\n\u2014The most innocent son of Erin, Stephen said, for whom they ever lifted them.\n\nAbout to pass through the doorway, feeling one behind, he stood aside.\n\nPart. The moment is now. Where then? If Socrates leave his house today, if Judas go forth tonight. Why? That lies in space which I in time must come to, ineluctably.\n\nMy will: his will that fronts me. Seas between.\n\nA man passed out between them, bowing, greeting.\n\n\u2014Good day again, Buck Mulligan said.\n\nThe portico.\n\nHere I watched the birds for augury. Aengus of the birds. They go, they come. Last night I flew. Easily flew. Men wondered. Street of harlots after. A creamfruit melon he held to me. In. You will see.\n\n\u2014The wandering jew, Buck Mulligan whispered with clown's awe. Did you see his eye? He looked upon you to lust after you. I fear thee, ancient mariner. O, Kinch, thou art in peril. Get thee a breechpad.\nManner of Oxenford.\n\nDay. Wheelbarrow sun over arch of bridge.\n\nA dark back went before them, step of a pard, down, out by the gateway, under portcullis barbs.\n\nThey followed.\n\nOffend me still. Speak on.\n\nKind air defined the coigns of houses in Kildare street. No birds. Frail from the housetops two plumes of smoke ascended, pluming, and in a flaw of softness softly were blown.\n\nCease to strive. Peace of the druid priests of Cymbeline: hierophantic: from wide earth an altar.\n\nLaud we the gods\nAnd let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils\nFrom our bless'd altars.12Embed"}
