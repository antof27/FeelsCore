{"Lyrics": "1 ContributorSERN LyricsLost in a question\nWithout you\nWithout you\nLost in the present now\nTime went on, way too long\nAnd I broke out\n\nI faced my crime of abandonment\nDid it and regretted it\nI am my own enemy\n\nBecause I won't be there for you\nWhen you fall down\nWhen you fall down\nEverytime I come back for you\nI'm someone else\nSomeone else without you there to prove I'm here\n\nHold back relapse, you know it will never chang\u0435\nMy timeline and my memori\u0435s\nThey are the ones to blame\nI'm falling in, I'm falling out\nI'm losing hope that this would fix itself\nI never knew that this would be hell\n\nBecause I won't be there for you\nWhen you fall down\nWhen you fall down\nEverytime I come back for you\nI'm someone else\nSomeone else without you there\nYou might also likeEverytime I let you in\nYou remain my medicine\nA shadow of the truth and your dismay\nI can't seem to find a way\nThe fate of losing you won't change\nSo why do I feel like it's my mistake\n\nYour savior's trapped there in a part of me that I left behind\nWill I find you this time\n\nTake my rejection as a proof I never swallowed my pride\nEvery deflection keeps the world from occupying my mind\nSo should I try again, open another door\n\nAnd face my crime of abandonment\nDid it and regretted it\nI am my own enemy oh\n\nBecause I won't be there for you\nWhen you fall down\nWhen you fall down\nEverytime I come back for you\nI'm someone else\nSomeone else without you there\n\nI won't be there for you\nWhen you fall down\nWhen you fall down\nEverytime I come back for you\nI'm someone else\nSomeone else without you there to prove I'm hereEmbed"}
