Coming right for your head\nGouge out your eyes, I wanna hear you say\nWho's the best and don't lie it's me all the way\nI'll turn you inside out, burn you down with my flames\nCut you up into pieces, I'm the best at the game\nGetting cold, temperature at Sub-Zero\nLooking like a Reptile who indeed needs a hero\nHere bro, I'll go Baraka, don't throw\nRip your head open then eat your brain like some cheetos\nTo me, this ain't a game we playing, immortal, always be slaying\nKombat for life, I'm a god like Raiden\nIf it's me your up against then boy you better be praying\nIf you go forward in time you're next to get me grave digging\n\n[Chorus: Random Pigeon Music]\nAs all the blood is spilt\nCan you taste the victory\nI'll knock you down, you won't breathe\nIt's too late to bend the knee\n\n[Verse 2: Connor Quest!]\nTwisting your spine the way I twist words\nVertebrate gets rearranged, swing so fast that my fist blurs\nMess your insides up so your shit churns and piss burns\nThink I'll go easy on you, you've misheard\nThis is violent dentistry, one punch and I'm taking your cavities, my one feeling for your well being, I'm afraid that it's apathy\nFatality, pain and agony, my rage isn't contained, I've a taste for things to maim and urge to go snap a knee\nBones shatter, ya dome splatters, the pieces all go scatter\nSplit you into bits and serve you up on a whole platter\nHits are all critical like your hospital condition\nDoctors wonder how your desophagus is in your excretory system\nGory isn't even the half of it, ripping each of his arms off him\nWhiplash pull out your ribs and your still beating heart with it\nBite is worse than the barking is, no deceit or an artifice\nLeave without a single mark, for me defeat ain't a part of this\nYou might also like[Chorus: Random Pigeon Music]\nAs all the blood is spilt\nCan you taste the victory\nI'll knock you down, you won't breathe\nIt's too late to bend the kneeEmbed"}
