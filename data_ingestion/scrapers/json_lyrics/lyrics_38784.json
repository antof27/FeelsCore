{"Lyrics": "2 ContributorsAmongst the Low & Empty LyricsRising from the flames\nPain sharpened my blade\nUnmasked, unchained\nI will never feel the same\n\nAmongst kings and queens\nThere's no in between\nWe are damned crooked fiends\n\nDwelling upon the serpents\nDrowning with other servants\nSwallowed by moving currents\n\nDeath can have me when it finds me\nDwelling amongst the low and empty fucks\n\nDwelling amongst the low and empty\nDwelling amongst the low and empty\n\nMy agony is what fucking fueled me\nMy agony is what fucking fueled me\n\nI'm fucked but still here\nStanding next to the fire\nIt's all become so clear\nSurviving an abyssal low\nA hell you'll never know\nDwelling in the depths\nBeneath every breath\nYou might also likeBleeding in the garden of Eden\nReaping what was sown and seeded\nBleeding in the garden of Eden\nBastard-born of angels and demons\n\nBleeding in the garden of Eden\nReaping what was sown and seeded\nBleeding in the garden of Eden\nBastard-born of angels and demons\n\nDwelling amongst the low and empty\nDwelling amongst the low and empty\n\nMy agony is what fucking fueled me\nDwelling amongst the low and empty\nLow and empty fucks\n\nNo one's hands around my neck but my own\nNothing left to cut my breath, empty and low\n\nSinking deeper in this hole\nI cannot control what the future holds\n\nI am\nAmongst the low and empty\nAmongst the low and empty\nI am\nAmongst the low and empty\nAmongst the low and empty\nLow and empty\nAmongst the low and emptyEmbed"}
