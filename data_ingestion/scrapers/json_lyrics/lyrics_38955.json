{"Lyrics": "3 Contributors13 MC\u2019s And 3 DJ\u2019s Lyrics[Verse 1: Flak/Fatface]\nThis goes out to those who question my skills\nI'm gonna snatch your mic like I used to snatch tills\nI get you open quicker than a fuckin' dent puller\n\"Can't rhyme, can't flow\", what's your name? Scott Muller\nMy raps will fuck you up and leave you in a daze\nLike Macy Gray, \"I'm the latest craze\"\nPlus my style is ill like the taste of [?]\n[?] \"It's everlasting Fat Face\"\n\n[Verse 2: Flee]\nFor those unfamiliar I'm known as the Flee\nMore renown for my gankin' than a dope MC\nThe situation's gonna change when I flex with [?]\nAnd fuck the shit up for this hardcore majority\nOf B-Boys and B-Girls, I'm a [?] lord\nI'ma burn your tires like Holden does Ford\nI've got more support than my mate Kevin Sheedy\nI'll spray your arse with my lyrical graffiti\n\n[Verse 3: Suffa]\nEverybody make room, 'cause I'm the fattest here\nOi, Debris, are you sure that, um, Fat Face can't hear?\nDuring sex, I listen to this beat to cum quicker\nI can do the Macy Gray too, \"Yo, I kick a\nRhyme and I choke\nTry to rep a style and I stumble\nAnd though I try to hide it, it's clear\nMy mind stopped working, I drank too much beer\"\nYou might also like[Scratches: DJ Debris]\n\"D

the rhythm up\"\n\"D motherfucker, d motherfucker\"\n\"Debris\"\n\n[Verse 4: Kolaps]\nProgress is imminent, my process, different\nRelevance to elements, presence in sentence\nElevate intercourse, superior exterior\nPenetrate and separate the planet you inhabit\nKolaps, exhale lyrics like a fire-breather\nButcherin' MCs like a psycho with a meat cleaver\nInformation about the congregation, here's the confirmation\nCross Bred Kings for world domination\n\n[Verse 5: Trauma]\nIt's the Culture Of Kings, collaborated talents\nAustralia's core for the underground balance\nAll swift in the style of lyrical amazement\nProficient productions in any arrangement\nServing severe extreme tracks, it's vital\nThe MCs and DJs who represent the title\nAll Australian, all artistically skilled\nAstonishing product produced and revealed\n[Verse 6: Edits]\nI'm representing After Hours, Certified Wise\nA culture of kings, we won't observe your guidelines\nAbide by our rhymes, speak the signs of the times\nRead the liners, we design the kind of styles to blow your mind\nFind south side explode your show like C4\nAnd Cross-Bred have got heads going like a seesaw\nDon't need more MCs to reinforce preconceived thoughts\nNeed to keep it real before you see war like Timor\n\n[Scratches: DJ Jugular]\n\"Jugulars\"\n\n[Verse 7: Simplex]\nTell me the feeling that you get\nWhen my words shatter your thoughts\n[?] to guard my metaphors from the MCs with a lesser cause\nThan originality, you wanna come and battle me?\nI'm such a fucking nice guy, even tell you my whole strategy\nI'll physically put you in a full body cast and after\nTorture you mentally by writing my lyrics all over your fuckin' plaster\nSimplex is the name that'll expose you as a bitch, that'll\nExplain why your girlfriend is a confused lesbian chick\n\n[Verse 8: Raph AL]\nRaph's phat like the face as Debris fills up the place\nFrom the tracks in morse code, explode the terror in Adelaide\nThe phrase catches atoms, now it's splitting the electrons\nConfuse the laws of physics by the movement of the crowd reaction\nTheir traction to the music's like an addiction that you're choosin'\n[?] gone to the pub and boozin'\nTraumatise you After Hours watchin' Kolaps [?]\n[?] suffer under the pressure from the kings [?] culture\n[Verse 9: Headlock]\nSometimes I find myself wanting to have sex with tracks\nApply GST to MCs [?] the wrong tax\nI want dickheads to have to pay more for their hats\nLife's a bitch and fucking with her gave me an STD\nI did research, After Hours found the cure for this disease\n[?] hook-up with a group of SA's illest MCs\nIn a monarchical country where the PM is incompetent\n[?] southern kings reign supreme on the continent\n\n[Verse 10: Integer]\nIf you can't see the truth you must be blind from too much direct sunlight\nWhen Adelaide B-Boys rock, you know it gets done right\nEvery rhyme I rhyme's tight to the point where my flow stun mics\nAnd slam harder than bass kicks or when snare drum strikes\nYour shit's so watered down you're rockin' styles only your mum like\n[?] destroy your career in one night\nThere's too many fake fuckwits makin' up stories, talking gun hype\nBut if you wish to challenge my crew then by all means come fight\n\n[Scratches: DJ Dyems]\n\"If you ain't rockin' raw, what you rockin' for?\"\n\"Yeah\"\n\"I give you the words, you know, the pasta and the salad bar\"\n\n[Verse 11: Blockade]\nIt's time, I design my strategy to be irritating like an allergy\nWhile my formality accepts stages, steps and lyrical reps\nFrom the original mental, which is beneficial\nMy technology expands amongst lands like grains of sand\nAustralian brand forever, never hesitant, this continent\nWill rock constant with this practical element\nBlockade's hitting like a hammer with this grammar, so I slam a\nCertain phrase, set the mic ablaze, call it technical programmer\n\n[Verse 12: Pressure]\nNow\nPressure came to set the measure as willing as ever\nWhether featherweight or heavy, step or put your hands together\nFor this like, not the next, that couldn't stress me out\nBut watch me now, as I cast shadows of doubt\nLike a pessimist, dancin' in a lunar eclipse\nWe took the best of this hip-hop scene and put 'em on riffs\nThey got suicidal tendencies, I tell 'em slit their wrists\n'Cause while their name was on my mind, my name was on their lips\n\n[Verse 13: DJ Debris]\nDebris came equipped with the new, not the same old shit\nI rock mics and break beats and always aim to hit\nEvery portion of your mind, many walk a thin line\nWhile we live the culture of kings in our hearts and our minds\nI make beats in my sleep that could still make you smile\nGive me a loop, I'll a style, give me an inch, I'll take a mile\nBut meanwhile, I stay on my feet, producin' for my peeps\nAnd by the way, you cats owe me for this beatEmbed"}
