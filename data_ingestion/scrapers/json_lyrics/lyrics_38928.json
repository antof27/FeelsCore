{"Lyrics": "1 ContributorWhen Will It Stop Hurting? Lyrics[Verse 1]\nMy eyes creep open from the afternoon light\nTry as I will but I just can\u2019t fight\nThis weight on my chest that\u2019s holding me down\nFeel like any second in my sheets I could drown\nEveryday feels the same all bleeding into one\nIf I could escape I can\u2019t tell you how fast I\u2019d run\nTo anywhere as long as its away from here\nIf I had the chance in a second I\u2019d disappear\nPain so deep feel it swelling in my lungs\nLike a wasp trapped inside myself I keep getting stung\nAnd my mind won\u2019t let me get out of bed\nThink I\u2019ll just stay inside\nTrapped in my head\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I just wanna know\nWhen will it stop hurting?\nWhen will I feel okay?\nGod please t\u0435ll me\nWill there \u0435ver come a day?\nWhen I don\u2019t wake up\nAnd feel this way\nI just wanna know\n\n[Verse 2]\nGod I really can\u2019t breathe\nFeel like the dark in the room is suffocating me\nTry not to think but I just can\u2019t stop\nWish the voice in my head would just shut the fuck up\nFeel myself fight for control\nCan I cut myself or am I too old?\nWonder if that would make me feel better or worse\nThink I might\u2019ve inherited the family curse\nPlay the same song again and again\nRepeat the part that makes me feel sad at the end\nHaunted by images I conjure in my mind\nThink they might follow me till the day I die\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nAnd I just wanna know\nWhen will it stop hurting?\nWhen will I feel okay?\nGod please tell me\nWill there ever come a day?\nWhen I don\u2019t wake up\nAnd feel this way\nI just wanna knowEmbed"}
