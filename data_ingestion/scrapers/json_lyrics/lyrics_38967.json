{"Lyrics": "3 Contributors\u200bfromjoy LyricsDismissed, disregard what was on my mind\nI\u2032m not surprised you don't listen\nI guess my peace of mind isn't worth this\n\nI've got a bone to pick with myself as I take apart who I am\nWho are you to point the finger when there's blood on your hands?\nEveryone is full of shit, and I'm just full of grief\nI'm already dead, so before I leave let me speak my peace\n\nI am weak and ugly\nNothing, just disgusting\nJust a fucking liar who's truth is disaster\n\nI'm too far gone, if I even tried saving myself, would it even matter?\nThe sound of doubt, it lingers, only here, away from joy, so my hopes aren't shattered\n\nWhen did the sun, the grass, and all my dreams become so bleak?\nEverything and everyone interferes, as my passions become my defeat\n\nPushing and pulling, picking and tearing away at me\nI'm gonna snap in half\nI'm getting pulled away from who I'm supposed to be\n\nMy peace of mind isn't worth thisYou might also likeEmbed"}
