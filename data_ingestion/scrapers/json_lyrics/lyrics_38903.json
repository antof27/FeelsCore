{"Lyrics": "5 ContributorsBetween Death And Dreams LyricsI've tasted death's desire\nI drank the plasma from the wrist\nLet go of feelings\nStared into ember eyes\nBlackness devoured, these eyes were once mine\nBlackness devoured, these eyes were never mine\nBut I don\u2019t know who's eyes they've become\n(Who th\u0435y've become)\nMy hom\u0435 has become my tomb\nNow bleed me dry\nSo I can be clean again\n\nNever ending agony\nNo sympathy\nMy misery, complete\n\nNever ending agony\nThe fear it lives on inside you and me\n(Inside of me)\nSeparating death from dreams\nNo sympathy\n(Sympathy)\nMy misery, complete\n\nI recognize that you're fading\nFrom the deception, you are sustaining\nYou might also likeI won't leave you in the dark\nForsake your legacy\nI will not leave you in the dark\nDesert in your misery\n\nNever ending agony\nThe fear it lives on inside you and me\n(Inside of me)\nSeparating death from dreams\nNo sympathy\n(Sympathy)\nMy misery, complete\n\nI recognize that you're fading\nFrom the deception, you are sustaining\nEyes of despair\nA face full of lust\n\nEternal damnation\nEternal damnation\n\nStaring into nothingness\nI am bound by fate with blood on my hands\nWriting in hopelessness\nEnsnared by the desolate screams\n(By the desolate screams)\nThis is your descent\nNever ending agony\nThe fear it lives on inside you and me\n(Inside of me)\nSeparating death from dreams\nNo sympathy\n(Sympathy)\nMy misery, complete\n\nBetween death and dreams\n(Eternal agony)\nPain becomes a part of me\n(I know I can\u2019t break free)\nBetween death and dreams\n(Eternal agony)\nPain becomes a part of me\n(I know I can\u2019t break free)Embed"}
