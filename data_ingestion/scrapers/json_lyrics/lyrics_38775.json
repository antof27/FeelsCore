{"Lyrics": "3 ContributorsBefore Your Eyes Lyrics[Verse: Rustage]\nFrom the moment we are born, there is a clock that keeps on ticking\nLike a metronome of life that represents the beats we living\nAnd our words are like a melody, so hear the people's singing\nA cacophony of noises that will shift with frequent listening\nEvery person that you know will weave a special kind of thread\nThere will be woven in a tapestry, it falls within your head\nAnd we will take those diff\u0435rent colours, wear them proudly on our ch\u0435sts\nBecame a perfect imperfection of our tryings and regrets\nBut our clocks of different settings, there are those who need our help\nAnd the alarms inside of tones will give us causing means to yell\nSo the pathways may seem endless, and it's more than we can tell\nBut did nobody a special, you are free to be yourself\nAnd I will never be the one to go and squander what I have\nAll the days that I have waited left to ponder out the map\nAnd though it seems that life will find a way to stop us in our tracks\nWe keep on working 'gainst the clock until our conscience turns to black\n\n[Chorus: McGwire]\nDown another winter, heart don't turn to stone\nAsk if I deliver, ask what I've been known\nSend it down like shivers, travels through their bones\nSay we move like Wizard, it's like magic when we're on\nDown another winter (this is my moment, this is my time), heart don't turn to stone (all of my hoping, all of my drive)\nAsk if I deliver (now I'm devoted, now I'm alive), ask what I've been known (this is my moment)\nSend it down like shivers (same shock, could never get ready), travels through their bones (thank god, you're holding me steady)\nSay we move like Wizard (I thought a mile in my mind), it's like magic when we're on (to gather my time and stopping my headache)\nDown another winter, heart don't turn to stone (I'm falling, I'm calling a memory of you)\nAsk if I deliver, ask what I've been known (I fall on your walls that I never come through)\nSend it down like shivers, travels through their bones (and we change, I know, so please take my call)\nSay we move like Wizard (no problems, just talking, what else can we do)You might also likeEmbed"}
