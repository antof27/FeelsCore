(Happy too)\nWhat if I\u2019m not the person you thought I'd be to you?\nWhat are the odds that I would be fuck\u0435d up too?\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nEach step is a mishap\nTo recap\nEach stab\nTo my back was deep and\nIt bled m\u0435 out for weeks\nIf I ever get the feedback\nThat we lack\nThis trap\nIt's intact\nAnd in fact\nIt kept me in the weeds\nEverything we are is gonna change\nAnd likely leave a stain\nThe mask will stay the same\n\n[Bridge]\nI wish that I could say this was a task that I can handle\nBut I\u2019m sure the outcome would have been the same\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat are the odds that I would be fucked up just like you?\nWhat are the odds that I would be happy too? (Happy too)\nWhat if I'm not the person you thought I'd be to you?\nWhat are the odds that I would be fucked up too? (Fucked up too!)\n(Each step is a mishap\nTo recap\nEach stab\nTo my back was deep\nAnd\nIt bled me out for weeks)\n\nBetter than I could do\nBetter than I've done before\nAnd now I want more\nBetter than I could do\nBetter than I've done before\nAnd now I want more\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat are the odds that I would be fucked up just like you?\nWhat are the odds that I would be happy too? (Happy too)\nWhat if I'm not the person you thought I'd be to you?\nWhat are the odds that I would be fucked up too?\n(Fucked up too!)\n\nWhat are the odds? (What are the odds?)\nWhat are the odds? (What are the odds?)\nWhat are the odds that I would be happy?Embed"}
