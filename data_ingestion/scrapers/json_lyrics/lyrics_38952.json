{"Lyrics": "1 ContributorAll Shall Be LyricsI welcome you to my death\nWhen I become eternity\n\nI have accepted my fate\nDelivered myself and kneeled before thee\nAnd now I can finally submit my soul\nRelease me\nRelieve me\nEternal torment now comes to an end\n\nSo tell me you won\u2019t\nRemember my name\nWhen I\u2019m buried beneath the sulfur\nBut in the end I hope\nI made you proud\nWe won\u2019t start again\n\nNo more remorse\nNo more regret\nYears of self hate\nHave now come to an end\nCome to an end\n\nSo tell me you won\u2019t\nRemember my name\nWhen I\u2019m buried beneath the sulfur\nBut in the end I hope\nI made you proud\nWe won\u2019t start again\nYou might also likeWe will never resetEmbed"}
