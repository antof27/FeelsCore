{"Lyrics": "1 ContributorPain LyricsI\u2032ve tried, but I cannot escape\nThis pain, misery conjuring inside of me\nI will devour the father and the holy son\nUpon this pulpit their blood seeps into rotten floorboards\nI will embrace this pain and misery\n\nObliterate\nSkin and mutilate\n\nCursed by the fire, dancing with death\nSpreading my pain across the earth\nThrough mountains and rivers, from dusk till dawn\nSpreading my pain between soil and sun\n\nTorment the souls of the innocent\nForging my path to the infinite\nMy throne awaits as I pile bodies to the heavens\nDesecrate, decimate, violate, devastate\nFeeding on nocturnal fear\nLacerate, masturbate, penetrate, annihilate\nThe morning feast is drawing near\n\nFeeding on nocturnal fear\n\nThe morning feast is drawing near\nYou might also likeSeparating, dissecting skin from bone\nSavagely defacing the beauty of God\nHarness the power of Yaldabaoth\nCreation, destruction\nI rule them both\n\nCursed by the fire, dancing with death\nSpreading my pain across the earth\nThrough mountains and rivers, from dusk till dawn\nSpreading my pain between soil and sun\n\nCursed by the fire, dancing with death\nSpreading my pain across the earth\nThrough mountains and rivers, from dusk till dawn\nSpreading my pain between soil and sun\n\nSoil, sun\n\n\"Beneath the den in the trenches, lies the core of eternal life\"\n\"You've made the sacrifice, your loyalty to pain remains divine\"\n\nDefacing the beauty of God\nSpreading pain between soil and sunEmbed"}
