{"Lyrics": "2 ContributorsKill Lyrics[Verse 1]\nEverybody said that you're no good for me\nBut you look so pretty when you're lying through your teeth\nAnd it hurts so good when you're picking my bones clean\nYeah, it could've been bad if you meant something to me\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSneaking suspicion\nI'll live to regret them\nThe days I spent in your bed, telling secrets as friends\n\n[Chorus]\nUse me\nJust like a plaything\nIf you can't have it then no one ever will\nSometimes we love what we kill\nStay\nMy little mistake\nGirl that cried heartbreak you're incapable of\nSometimes we kill what we love\n\n[Verse 2]\nVirgin to the truth\nTwo different points of view\nRepeat it in your head until you think it's true\nDid your best to cut me deep I think that's cute\nIf that makes me the devil, then what does that make you?\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nReceived my sentence\nI learned to accept it\nI fear for your conscience\nDoes it even exist?\n\n[Chorus]\nUse me\nJust like a plaything\nIf you can't have it then no one ever will\nSometimes we love what we kill\nStay\nMy little mistake\nGirl that cried heartbreak you're incapable of\nSometimes we kill what we love\n\n[Outro]\nSent from above\nNot yours to love\nYou're not the one I'm thinking of\nSent from above\nNot yours to love\nYou're not the one I'm thinking of\nSent from above\nNot yours to love\nYou're not the one I'm thinking of\nSent from above\nNot yours to love\nYou're not the one I'm thinking ofEmbed"}
