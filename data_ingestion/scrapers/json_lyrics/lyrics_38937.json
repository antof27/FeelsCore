{"Lyrics": "1 ContributorThrough the Storm (Bonus Track) Lyrics[Intro: Mike Firm]\nDo you lose yourself, along the way?/\nA hustler never stops and a critic only sees/\nWhat it could be/\n\n[Verse 1: Mike Firm]\nRunning from my problems, troubles in my vision/\nSee the faults at my core, and I can\u2019t bare witness/\nTestify, Empire/\nIn your cookie jar/\nDrown in the pussy, oasis in the desert/\nLike fine wine, you know I\u2019m never finished/\nA thin line vices come in threes/\nA m\u00e9nage trois, a catastrophe/\nVoice of reason, you never seemed so distant/\n\n[Chorus: Mike Firm]\nFall back, fall back\nSurviving the night/\nHips are moving, you\u2019re the center of attention/\nCan\u2019t escape, like an omen\u2019s threat/\nPsychedelic impulse enjoy your stay, let\u2019s go/\nStand up, arms high, floating in the clouds/\nNight out, perreo, foaming at the mouth/\nDJ got us bumping, it\u2019s ecstasy/\nThe heat is rising, I\u2019m the recipe/\nYou might also like[Verse 2: Mike Firm]\nFar from riches, money turning fables/\nI make my own luck, and we\u2019re ripping all the labels/\nStuck in pose, and the roses of the cradle/\nReaching for the stars, and taking up the mantle/\nIt\u2019s underground, and you hear the sound/\nAnd you best believe, that it\u2019s going down/\nLegends never die, and they never fold/\nIt\u2019s touchdown smoke-out guns out bangin\u2019/\nFast life, speedball, rush, and it\u2019s lethal/\nWeapon of choice, Odachi and Tant\u014d/\nProtect at all costs, justice and the gavel/\nFlashes of light, red and blue stand tough/\nFuck the line, the revolution never dies/\nThey want us to break, but there are other pillars/\nThe culture exposes, it won\u2019t be televised/\nPumping lead and red like the enemy\u2019s jugular/\n\n[Chorus: Mike Firm]\nFall back, fall back\nSurviving the night/\nHips are moving, you\u2019re the center of attention/\nCan\u2019t escape, like an omen\u2019s threat/\nPsychedelic impulse enjoy your stay, let\u2019s go/\nStand up, arms high, floating in the clouds/\nNight out, perreo, foaming at the mouth/\nDJ got us bumping, it\u2019s ecstasy/\nThe heat is rising, I\u2019m the recipe/\n[Bridge: Mike Firm]\nPilot talk\u2026/\nFlying to the next show\u2026/\nHeadliner\u2026/\nIt\u2019s a world tour (it\u2019s a world tour)\u2026/\nConcert highs\u2026/\nStuck with the down lows\u2026/\nChase my dreams\u2026/\nBut who get\u2019s hurt?/\n\n[Verse 3: Mike Firm]\nI can\u2019t seem to get it, I try too hard (downlows)/\nI don\u2019t want to fail, and I want to ball (downlows)/\nI doubt myself, and I want to scream/\nI chase the green, but I\u2019m vanity/\nI change the pace, and I need some space/\nI trust no one, and I push em\u2019 away/\nI can\u2019t bear the weight, I have nothing to say/\nI want to leave, I can\u2019t make the grade/\nWe fight back\u2026 down for the cause/\nPublic enemy, you fuckers can\u2019t stop us/\nWe don\u2019t need your money, mirrors and twists/\nContortions of the body, calling the red phone/\nPut em on the board, consider all angles/\nA Thousand Suns, brighter mass numbers/\nLong and short game, the marathon and sprint/\nStrategize chess and we\u2019re steps ahead/\nBreathe./Embed"}
