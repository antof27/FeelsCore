{"Lyrics": "2 ContributorsThe Level Beneath LyricsI am lost\nI am a decapitated soul\nWandering through the dark woods of hate\n\nUnrelenting anger and evil invade\nMy cherished world has all ended in vein\nDirectionless and worthless human shape\nDegraded self I've lost, my mind infuriates\n\nWorthless\nFucking human shell\nWorthless\nConjuring hate you will remain in hell\nWait for the kill as pulsing worms gnaw\nThe raven sings to me a symbol of my law\nI've counted every day I've wanted to die\nDec\u0435ption rules my reality\nEntombed in disgust amongst this world of li\u0435s\nNo peace, no pity\nFor the slaves of this dying breed\n\nThese rotting shells must be sacrificed\nSo that earth can be freed\n\nI am lost\nI am a decapitated soul\nWandering through the dark woods of hate\nPit of loathing anger\nAs I'm lost in the dark\nI cry out in regret, and my death becomes art\nLet my life end in this natural realm\nThere's no meaning, there's nothing that I've ever felt\nYou might also likeDrag me into a shattered glass realm of death\nWhen I ascend from this world there will be nothing left\nLooking upwards at night I close my eyes in the rain\nThe only input I have is pain\nMotherfucker\n\nWe are the creations of the level below\nThe deepest region of the river's flowEmbed"}
