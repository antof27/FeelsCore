{"Lyrics": "1 ContributorDevil\u2019s Ground Lyrics(Music by: Mat Sinner, Ralf Scheepers, Stefan Leibing, Tom Naumann)\n\nHe himself said, that hell was originally prepared for the devil and his angels\nIn hell, you will be ruled over and will be inferior by darkness and the forces of evil. Your\nNew home will be made up of demons, fallen angels, wickedness and even the lord of\nDarkness himself... you will be at the bottom of the guest list\n\nThe sphere of hell is a hollowed-out place in the earth's core\nScientists proved that the earth's\nOuter crust is less than twenty miles thick and that beyond that point, there are rivers and\nLakes of flaming blood of the earth, called the \"lake of fire\". Long\nBefore the final judgment, of the thousand suns you will find the gates to hell in burning ruins of\nThe new city\n\nWhen the sinner closes his eyes for the second death and darkness takes his soul, you will see\nAnd feel movements in the air. The saviors are open you and there will be no triumph without loss, no freedom\nFor your soul without sacrifice. There's only specific kind of creature, who ever\nCame back from the eternal\n\nThis very moment, your eternal soul may be less than twenty miles from the burning fires of hell!\n\nIf you go to hell, be sure - You'll be there forever...You might also likeEmbed"}
