{"Lyrics": "1 ContributorDead People Lyrics(Madness)\nHad a heart attack I stood for 26 hours\nSummoned from the dead by crack cocaines addictive powers\nSmoke comin form the closet\nI'm takin a shit been through it a bit\nInside of the closet with my fellow crack fiends\nI see three sixes form in their smoke rings\nMiddle of the bass my heart no longer pounds\nThe flicker of the lighter is the only sound\nI look down at the crawl space\nWith my feet I wipe unborn crackhead babies in place\nI look at my reflection in a pipe and it forms into a skull\nI hear the rats mating and scratching in the hall\nMy body begins mixing and changing into\nA chemical rection that I can't explain\nCAINE from a pipe while my wife gives the dope man head\nI'd ditch the bitch but I'm already dead\n\nDead people Dead people ain't the ones to be scared of\nDead people Dead people ain't the ones to be scared of\nDead people Dead people ain't the ones to be scared of\nThe living people are...\n\n(Staplez)\nMaybe this is true but you never met me\nA dead homie come back to life thats who I be\nI was shot six times in my head\nYou're scared of the living you fuckers better be scared of the undead\nOnce I stalked my killers for revenge of my death\nAnd I'm killin all them mother fuckers takin my last breath\nI seen them drinking at the liquor store\nSlangin bangin and grippin their whores\nThey see me and they panic then they fuckin shoot me\nBut them bullets just pass right fuckin through me\nThen I pulled out the piece that their homies buried me with\nI smell like shit from bein dead I'm stiff\nRigamortis can't stop this fuckin shit\nStarted cappin everyone I unloaded the clip\nI shot the last one six times in his face dead\nAnother tries to grab me in the mist I dissapear\nYou might also likeDead people Dead people ain't the ones to be scared of\nDead people Dead people ain't the ones to be scared of\nDead people Dead people ain't the ones to be scared of\nThe living people are...\n\n(Prozak)\nI died of AIDS but the devils man came back\nDo you think that Magic Johnson will be capable of that?\nFuck no!
