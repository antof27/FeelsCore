Voice has come\n(Voices settle) Voices are gone (Into battle)\nAm I still the prince of fire on my own?\n\n[Verse 2: Daniel Estrin]\nSworn to kill now when we were all as one\nLay your sword down and we were all but done\nLay your sword down in my arms again (Again)\n\n[Bridge: Daniel Estrin, Alex Canion]\nAgain\nIs it better? Is it better? Is it better again?\nThe voices\u2014 (Go)\nYou might also like[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Bridge: Daniel Estrin]\nIs it better?\nIs it better?\nIs it better?\n\n[Outro: Daniel Estrin, Alex Canion]\nThe voices go\n(Are we better?) Voice has come\n(Voices settle) Voices are gone (Into battle)\nAm I still the prince of fire on my own?Embed"}
