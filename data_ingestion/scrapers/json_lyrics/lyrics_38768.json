{"Lyrics": "1 ContributorTemporary Existence LyricsRestricted by my anxiety\nEach day is the same\nI can't be set free\nThe question keeps on taunting me\nHow is existence a possibility?\n\nI keep observing from behind my eyes\nI'm just a mind portrayed as flesh and bone\nI miss the old days\nBut this pain still feels the same\n\nI have no choice but to keep asking myself\nWhy do these walls feel like an endless room?\nThe walls keep bleeding red\nAnd all the memories keep on scarring me\nEndlessly\n\nTrapped with walls\nBleeding red\nEndlessly\nI can't escap\u0435 my mind\nI can't escape the r\u0435d room\nUnless I end myself\n\nBut I still miss the way things used to be\nBack before this room filled with anxiety\nMy life seems to make no sense\nTrapped in a temporary existence\nYou might also likeI miss the old days\nBut this pain still feels the same\nI miss the old days\nBut this pain still feels the same\nI miss the old days\nBut this pain still feels the same\n\nI miss the old days\nBut this pain...\nThis pain still feels the sameEmbed"}
