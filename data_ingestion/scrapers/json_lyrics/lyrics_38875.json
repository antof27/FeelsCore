{"Lyrics": "29 ContributorsIntro Lyrics[Verse: Vince Staples]\nLive from Delusion\nDie on the street or reside in the ruins\nRun and hide from police, throw the 9 in the sewer\n25 is the least of the time that you doin'\nDo or die, staying true to the lies on the stand\nRight hand on the word of a God and forget\nAll the wrongs that you did tryna live by your means\nBreaking news, 10 PM, see your friends on the screen\nAnd these bitches wanna talk about some ma'fuckin' rap\nBullet holes in the home where my lil' brother at\nPigs parked on the street, so we can't shoot back\nSpent a week where I sleep, most can't do that\nMight look half neat 'til the nightfall come\nFirst the Goodyear screech then you hear that drum\nFuck 911, police don't come\nHad Jabari on the streets 'til the sun came up\nMomma's son raised up in the midst of a feud\nI'm from genocide where you die for your residence\nDie for the presidents I chase who reached the same fate\nSo I never get to thrive in the relishment\nMight seem jaded but even Satan was heaven-sent\nCould've been a bum, broke sleeping by the 710\n17 dropped out, knew I had to make a way\nCouldn't have my granny broke 'fore she see the pearly gates\nHope she ain't judged for me\nOnly person livin' ever showed love to me\nDad did time 'cause he sold drugs for me\nI could never judge a man tryna better off his fam\nShoot a fucker where he stand, gotta take you to your maker\n'Til I'm buried in the grass and the candle light the pavement\nI'ma do it to the best of my abilities, the fear in me is gone\nYou can hear it in the song while you listenin'\nYou might also like[Outro: Delusional Thomas]\nVince Staples and Larry Fisherman\nPresent\nTales of the Stolen Youth\nWe appreciate it10Embed"}
