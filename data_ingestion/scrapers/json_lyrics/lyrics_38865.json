{"Lyrics": "2 ContributorsThe Dark Passenger LyricsI hope you know that I was better off\nSurviving on my own\nYou saw the struggle within\nTaking control of me\nIt's dragging me under\nTold you are the way you are because of your blood line\nA generation held by a gun of false information\n\nLooking into a mirror with no reflection\nBattling the minute\nThe gun is not an option\n\nNot knowing that, turning your head\nYou leave him for dead\nFilling his heart with lead\n\nThe dark passenger, feeds upon everything I will never dream to be\nFeared enemy, a society that has created a further distraction\n\nThe feeling that you will be killed for your actions\nDependent on the structure\nOf your own experience\nBreaking the mold of their expectations\nThe death toll rises as a a blindness nation sits and profits\n\nRun it\nYou might also likeThis weight is held upon you like a brick\nSo sick of feeling ignorant, holding on by a thread\nTake it back\n\nThe dark passenger, feeds upon everything I will never dream to be\nFeared enemy, a society that has created a further distraction\n\nFeels like a lifetime\nIt would be so much easier to close these eyes\nLive to survive, wake and realize\nTransparency for my enemies\nA chill down your spine, to turn your back for the very last time\nTurn your back for the very last time\n\nYou're blue to the face, choking, no breath to fucking take\nYour word means nothing\nNo pity for the fucking fake\nYour word means nothingEmbed"}
