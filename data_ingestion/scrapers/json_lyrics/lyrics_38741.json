{"Lyrics": "13 ContributorsGoku VS Naruto [Extended + Remastered} Lyrics[Verse 1: Goku]\nThis is a monumental mismatch\nThis kid, he doesn't stand a chance\nSuperhuman strength\nNow, I'll wait while you shit your pants\nIt's Goku, son\nI even got the drop on Superman\nYou didn't come to battle, nah\nYou look more like a superfan\nBut you'll still get the opportunity\nYour looks attempt to mirror me, except I've gone through puberty\nSo here lies Naruto\nI've dug a ditch and picked your plot\nAnd you'll regret the day that you ever challenged Kakarot\n\n[Verse 2: Naruto Uzumaki]\nWorld strongest?\nBut it looks like it's my time\nNinja of the highest order, plus I've got some dope rhymes\nIt's Naruto\nAnd I'm a top shelf shinobi\nWhich one of your thirty forms are you about to show me?\nI'm relentless\nI possess a will of fire\nYour dragonballs look saggy\nThink it's time that you retired\nSuperhuman strength?\nBut you're still someone's bitch\nI asked around and I heard Chi-Chi's got your pussy whipped\nYou might also like[Verse 3: Goku]\nHow dare you test my patience\nI did my best to remain calm\nNow, it's gone\nYou will learn, here's a spirit lyric bomb\nI'll power level form switch\nKamehameha this bitch\nMaster Roshi taught me well\nSee this Nine-Tailed scrub in hell\nI am the hope of the universe\nYou'll never measure up to me\nYou should've brought your whole team, you still could never fuck with me\nAbove the imitators, flying nimbus high above this fraud\nThey let a cross dressing cubscout go to battle with a god\n\n[Verse 4: Naruto]\nCall me an imitation?\nYou're a lower-class soldier\nYour planet's just a memory\nGo cry on Bulma's shoulder\nAnd speaking of your girls, got Chi-Chi flowing like Niagara Falls\nI think he's carrot's going soft\nYou need Viagra dragonballs\nI'll end it now or wait until the morning to defeat ya\nWouldn't wanna interrupt your \"fusion\" nights with Vegeta\nSo gather up your balls, you'll need wishes to defeat me\nAnd Hyberbolic training\nYour flow's shittier than GT\n[Verse 5: Goku]\nSay what you want but\nMy movies are a goldmine\nGoing 20 years plus\nAnd you'll be gone in no time\nYou're asking for it so I had to\nCome and kick your ass again\nDestroy an Uzumaki\nWith nothing more than my Kao Ken\n\n[Verse 6: Naruto]\nI've been though a world war\nBeating you is nothing, Son\nDeadliest ninja around\nCheck and see who's number 1\nThe Uzumaki Undertaker\nBury a Saiyan beneath\nYou just got destroyed\nBy the Hero of the Hidden Leaf4Embed"}
