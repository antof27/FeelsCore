{"Lyrics": "9 ContributorsA PEAceful Outroduction Lyrics[Verse 1]\nIt was nice to meet you, I love making friends\nBut every good mixtape must come to an end\nWhen the next one drops I hope that I'll see you again\n'Til then I'll pick the pen up with the strength of ten men (Amen)\nDon't you forget your favorite goof ball, gluten free rapper\nWearing chucks with the flannel, call it denim jacket dapper\nWest coast and Washingtonian, the super loud laugher\nThat Jesus lovin', church goin' son of a pastor\nHey, shout out to my homies back in Federal Way\nHey, the 253 is in me, I am born and raised\nHey, I can't see myself in any other state\nHey, I love the PNW so let it rain\nMy brain is feeling new dude, good mood\nThese is lyrics that you gotta chew dude, like good food\nMusic is magic that is true dude, no voodoo\nMy favorite rappers are my gurus\nGrew up on the see-through purple plastic Gameboy Color\nAnd the OG Nintendo 64 Smash Brothers\nStill play the same games, I'm a kid undercover\nNo wonder my life is fun, it's just like school after summer\nIt's a bummer when others throw they fun into the gutter\nGives me shudders\nYou're tough for sure but don't make yourself suffer\nHave some Gushers, don't mutter\nMove your feet and go get smothered in a bear hug\nFeel the love, now go and get her number\nDon't step to me if all you bring is negativity\nYou've gotta choose to see the world the way it should be seen\nBeauty times infinity, pickup or proclivity\nFrom powerfully prolific potential positivity\nMan I don't got time to wait in line to make a dime\nYou know that life ain't 'bout that grind and dollar signs and dollar lines\nThat says you'll find happiness inside that you can't buy yourself a high\nBut that ain't right, I've made up my mind, I'm writing rhymes until I die\nYou might also like[Hook]\nGive a nod to the folks who think I'm odd\nI don't mess with no facade, I'm too busy being PEABOD\nRolling with my squad like we peas in the pod\nI take comfort in the rod and the staff of my God\n\n[Verse 2]\nAll these rappers always making lofty claims like\n\"Yo, I'm what happens when James Brown meets Kanye\"\nSure, I'm more like if Arthur Read picked up the bass\nAnd grew up playing in church and with some tracks by Beyonce\nI'm if reckless ate breakfast with my best friends every day\nIf restless made a checklist and got down to business right away\nMy bucket list is enormous, I ain't got time to waste\nMake music more, love people more, enjoy the Lord, those are some faves\nIf people pleasing had it's way I'd never meet my goals\nSometimes the most important word that I can say is \"no\"\nNo, I won't try to be Migos\nNo, I won't rip off my heroes\nNo, not in it for the zeroes\nAll of y'all let me be clear though\nI ain't got time to take myself or you too seriously\nKeeping up appearances just feels so weird to me\nIf I can't be me then tell me who am I supposed to be?\nIf I won a Grammy I'd thank God in my acceptance speech\nThat sounds like freedom, sounds like light, it sounds like color\nTold you in the introduction that is where I'm trying to hover\nLike dreaming 'bout the old days with my sister and brother\nIf joy is in the rain then I'll be praying hard for thunder\nLook in my eyes, I'm pretty sure that you'll see lightning\n'Cause when the skies the limit everything's exciting\nThis music got me feelin' like I have been flying\nTime to land this plane for now 'cause I need to get writing\nTime to write some songs about my girl and what I've been through\nSome will be rap, some will be folk, and some just might be blues\nBut don't you worry, there's more PEABOD music comin' soon\nFor now I just got one more thing to say to you\nI hope you see me firstly as a follower of Jesus\nMy songs are full of joy because I know the One who frees us\nIf you remember any line then let it be my thesis\nJesus loves you, Hallelujah, he will never leave us\n[Hook]\nGive a nod to the folks who think I'm odd\nI don't mess with no facade, I'm too busy bein' PEABOD\nRolling with the squad like we peas in the pod\nI take comfort in the rod and the staff of my God\nGive a nod to the folks who think I'm odd (This is good for me, good for everybody)\nI don't mess with no facade, I'm too busy bein' PEABOD (Healthy snacks and ha-a-appy raps, it's a party)\nRolling with the squad like we peas in the pod (This is good for me, good for everybody)\nI take comfort in the rod and the staff of my God (Healthy snacks and ha-a-appy raps, it's a party)\nGive a nod to the folks who think I'm odd (This is good for me, good for everybody)\nI don't mess with no facade, I'm too busy bein' PEABOD (Healthy snacks and ha-a-appy raps, it's a party)\nRolling with the squad like we peas in the pod (This is good for me, good for everybody)\nI take comfort in the rod and the staff of my God (Healthy snacks and ha-a-appy raps, it's a party)\nGive a nod to the folks who think I'm odd (This is good
