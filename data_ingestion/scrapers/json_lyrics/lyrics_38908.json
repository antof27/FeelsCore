{"Lyrics": "1 ContributorSingle Lines LyricsPoems... Metaphors we transcend Moments... Live and last beyond their end\nSimple emotions can happen so fast Without warning Smashing, stealing replies...Revealing other rhymes\nFrom the syntax of our life\nSingle lines Down I paint From the ink you're giving me Living scars I crave So deep in my open ...Heart\nSilence... Words cannot define pain Feelings... Different meanings different ways\nDueling and feeding we riddle the flame Constantly changing Loosing and healing regaining concealing The human passion we unchain\nStronger than a hurricane\nSingle lines Down I paint From the ink you're giving me Living scars I crave So deep in my open ...Heart\nSingle Lines Single Lines Single Lines Single LinesYou might also likeEmbed"}
